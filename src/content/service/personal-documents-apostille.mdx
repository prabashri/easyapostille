faq:
  - question: "Do personal documents use HRD or SDM?"
    answer: "Personal documents (birth, marriage, PCC, affidavits) typically go **Notary → SDM → MEA**. HRD is generally for **education** documents. We’ll confirm your exact route after a quick review."
    speakable: true
  - question: "Original vs scan—what does MEA accept?"
    answer: "For **Sticker apostille**, originals are commonly needed. For **e-Apostille (QR)**, good scans often work if your destination allows. Some States still ask for originals—we’ll confirm upfront."
  - question: "How long does it take?"
    answer: "**SDM → MEA** cases usually complete in **~2–3 working days** after acceptance. If extra verification or reissue is needed, we’ll share a realistic ETA before payment."
  - question: "How much does it cost?"
    answer: "MEA’s official fee is **₹50/₹90** per document. Our **SDM bundle is ₹2,000 per document** (Notary + SDM (Delhi) + MEA + premium pickup/return). **5–10% discounts** for multi-document orders."
  - question: "Will I get tracking and updates?"
    answer: "Yes—**order ID**, proactive **WhatsApp/email** updates at each step, e-copy/QR where applicable, and **secure courier** return of originals."

## Documents Required

- The **personal document** (Birth / Marriage / PCC / Affidavit) — scan or original as advised  
- **Passport** (first/last page) of the document holder (both spouses for marriage)  
- **Authorization + ID** if a family member submits for you  
- **Affidavit / Gazette / correction proof** if names or dates differ

## Step-by-Step

1. **Eligibility check** — share a scan; we confirm **Sticker vs e-Apostille** and **original vs copy**, based on the destination checklist.  
2. **Pickup/hand-in & verification** — we prep your file to prevent rejections.  
3. **Notary** *(if required)* → **SDM (Delhi)** or **State Home Dept** *(as needed)*  
4. **MEA Apostille** — Sticker on original or e-Apostille (QR).  
5. **Instant digital share** — scan/e-Apostille PDF + verification link.  
6. **Secure delivery** — insured, tracked return of originals.

## Timelines

- **SDM → MEA:** typically **~2–3 working days** once in process.  
- **State Home Dept** or **reissue/translation** can extend timelines. We’ll share your **firm ETA** upfront.

## Original vs Copy (personal-doc quick rules)

- **Birth & Marriage:** many authorities want **Sticker on original**; e-Apostille only if the recipient explicitly accepts copies/scans.  
- **PCC / Medical:** short validity **and** usually returned → **Sticker on original**.  
- Always follow the **recipient’s written checklist** to avoid delays.

## Special Cases

- **Old/faded certificates:** consider a **fresh municipal reprint** before apostille.  
- **Name/surname changes:** we guide on **affidavit** vs **Gazette** vs **reissue**.  
- **Couple/holder abroad:** a **parent/relative** can submit locally with authorization.

## Delivery & Tracking

- **Pan-India pickup & secure return** in serviceable locations  
- **Proactive WhatsApp/email updates** at each milestone  
- **Tamper-proof packaging** and **tracking ID** on dispatch
