faq:
  - question: "Do I need to submit the original TC or will a scan work?"
    answer: "For **Sticker Apostille**, the **original TC** is typically required. For **e-Apostille (QR)**, good **scans** may be acceptable in many cases. We’ll confirm eligibility after reviewing your document."
    speakable: true
  - question: "Does a school Transfer/Leaving Certificate require HRD attestation?"
    answer: "Usually **no**. School-level certificates normally follow **Notary → SDM → MEA**. If a specific authority requires a different path, we’ll advise before payment."
  - question: "My TC is a few years old—do I need a reissue?"
    answer: "Older TCs are often acceptable if they are clear and properly signed/stamped. Some destinations prefer recent reissues—share a scan and we’ll confirm."
  - question: "Is e-Apostille (QR) accepted by universities or schools abroad?"
    answer: "Many institutions accept **e-Apostille** with online **QR verification**. A few still insist on the **physical sticker**. We’ll recommend the right mode for your destination."
  - question: "How long does TC apostille take?"
    answer: "Most SDM → MEA cases finish in **~2–3 working days** after acceptance. If extra verification is needed, we’ll share a realistic ETA up front."
  - question: "How much will it cost?"
    answer: "MEA charges **₹50/₹90** per document. The final quote varies with **Notary/SDM** steps and logistics. Most providers quote **~₹1,500–₹3,000**/document. **Multi-document orders get progressive discounts.**"
  - question: "How will I receive updates and my documents?"
    answer: "We assign an **order ID** and share **WhatsApp/email** updates. You’ll receive a **scan** or **e-Apostille PDF + verification link**, and **secure courier** return of originals."

## Who needs a Transfer/Leaving Certificate apostilled?
Students moving abroad for **school admission**, **dependent visas**, or **residency formalities** where a **school TC/LC** is requested by the receiving authority.

---

## What we handle
- **School Transfer Certificate / Leaving Certificate (TC/LC)**
- Associated **bonafide/character** letters if requested by the destination authority

> Not sure if your TC qualifies? Share a clear scan—we’ll confirm eligibility and the fastest compliant route.

## e-Apostille (QR) vs Sticker
- **e-Apostille (QR):** Digital apostille with **online QR verification** from MEA. Fast and widely accepted.  
- **Sticker Apostille:** **Physical sticker** affixed to the document; a few authorities still require this format.

We’ll recommend the right mode for your **country** and **application**.

---

## What we need to start
- **Clear scan/photo** of the **TC/LC** and a valid **ID** (Passport/Aadhaar)  
- If a parent/guardian submits: an **Authorization Letter** (we’ll share a template)  
- If originals are needed: a **pickup/courier address** for door-to-door logistics

---

## Typical route (school documents)
**Notary → SDM → MEA (Sticker or e-Apostille QR)**  
We manage the exact path and tell you upfront if any board/school verification is required.

---

## Process at a glance
1. **Share scans** → quick eligibility & route confirmation  
2. **Confirm & pay** (UPI/Bank transfer; invoice on request)  
3. We complete **Notary → SDM → MEA**  
4. You receive a **scan/e-Apostille PDF + QR link** and **secure courier** return of originals

**Multi-document orders** (e.g., TC + marksheets) get **progressive discounts**.
