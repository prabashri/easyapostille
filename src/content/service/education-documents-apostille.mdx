faq:
  - question: "Do I need HRD attestation before MEA apostille?"
    answer: "It depends on the issuing university/state policy and destination requirement. Many cases can go via Notary → SDM → MEA. Some universities/states or evaluators still insist on HRD first. We’ll check your university and advise the fastest compliant route."
    speakable: true
  - question: "Are originals required or will scans work?"
    answer: "For e-Apostille (QR), good scans may be enough in many cases. For Sticker apostille, originals are typically required. Certain states/universities still need originals even for e-Apostille—we’ll confirm after eligibility review."
  - question: "Is a Provisional Degree accepted for apostille?"
    answer: "Yes, if properly issued by the university. Some destinations prefer the final degree; if time-sensitive, we can apostille the provisional and later apostille the final if needed."
  - question: "Do sealed transcripts need apostille?"
    answer: "Evaluators usually want sealed transcripts sent directly. If a foreign authority asks for apostille, we can apostille the transcript (opened and certified) or an official verification letter—case by case."
  - question: "How long does education apostille take?"
    answer: "Typical timelines are ~2–3 working days (SDM → MEA). Add time if HRD or university verification is needed. You get a real ETA before payment."

## Routing & Eligibility (HRD vs SDM)

- **Standard (many cases):** Notary → **SDM** → **MEA (Sticker or e-Apostille)**  
- **When required:** **HRD/State Education** → MEA (varies by State/university or recipient policy)  
- **e-Sanad:** used when your Board/University is listed; some still charge genuineness

We'll review your scans and reply with **route** and **firm ETA** before payment.


## Documents Required

- **Degree/Provisional/Diploma/Marksheet(s)** as per recipient list  
- **Passport** (first/last page)  
- **University verification/e-Sanad details** if needed  
- **Notarized copy** only for copy/e-Apostille route (when permitted)

## Step-by-Step

1. **Share scans** → we confirm **SDM vs HRD/e-Sanad** and **Sticker vs e-Apostille**  
2. **Pickup/hand-in & verification** → names/USN/dates checked to avoid rejections  
3. **Notary** *(if required)* → **SDM** or **HRD/e-Sanad**  
4. **MEA Apostille** — Sticker or e-Apostille (QR)  
5. **Instant digital share** — PDF + verification link  
6. **Secure return** — insured, tracked courier

## Timelines

- **SDM route:** ~**2-3 working days** once in process  
- **HRD/e-Sanad:** varies by State/university verification queue (we share a **realistc ETA**)

## Original vs Copy

- If the recipient **demands physical verification**, use **Sticker on original**.  
- If they **accept e-Apostille**, a **notarized copy/scan** can be faster and safer (keeps originals free).  
- We always follow the **recipient's written checklist**.
