faq:
  - question: "Do I need to send the original marriage certificate?"
    answer: "For Sticker apostille, many embassies/visa centers require the original. For e-Apostille (QR), a scan may be accepted—only if your recipient’s checklist allows. We confirm before payment."
    speakable: true

  - question: "Are religious/ceremony certificates (church/temple/Arya Samaj) enough?"
    answer: "No. Apostille is issued on the civil **Marriage Registration Certificate** from the Registrar/Sub-Registrar/SDM. Ceremony certificates can be attached as supporting documents if you wish."
    speakable: false

  - question: "Court marriage or inter-state marriage—any difference?"
    answer: "Both are fine as long as you have the civil registration certificate. Inter-state documents may need translation if issued in a regional language."
    speakable: false

  - question: "Name change after marriage—will that be a problem?"
    answer: "Not usually. If there’s a spelling change or surname adoption, we may add an affidavit or Gazette copy. We’ll advise the simplest compliant path."
    speakable: false

  - question: "How long does apostille take?"
    answer: "Most marriage certificates finish in ~2–3 working days once in process. If your destination insists on State Home Department (instead of SDM) or a fresh reprint, timelines may extend. We share a firm ETA up front."
    speakable: true

  - question: "Can a family member apply while we are abroad?"
    answer: "Yes. A parent/relative can submit with authorization and ID copies. We’ll send the short checklist."
    speakable: false

  - question: "Do I need translation?"
    answer: "If the certificate isn’t in English/Hindi and the recipient requires English, a certified translation is recommended. We can arrange it."
    speakable: false

  - question: "Sticker vs e-Apostille—which should I choose?"
    answer: "Follow the recipient’s written preference. If they accept e-Apostille, it’s fast and shareable. If they demand physical verification, choose Sticker on the original."
    speakable: false

## Documents Required

- **Marriage Registration Certificate** (scan or original as advised)  
  - Issued by **Registrar/Sub-Registrar/SDM** (civil registration)  
  - Religious/ceremony certificates **alone** are **not** sufficient  
- **Passports** of both spouses (first/last pages)  
- **Address proof** (optional; if requested by recipient)  
- **Authorization + ID** of submitting family member (if couple is abroad)  
- **Affidavit/Gazette** for name updates (if needed)  
- **Certified translation** (if the certificate is not in English/Hindi and the recipient requires English)

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Eligibility check** — Share a scan; we confirm **Sticker vs e-Apostille** and **original vs copy**, based on the recipient’s checklist.  
2. **Pickup/hand-in & verification** — We pre-check names/dates and fix gaps to avoid rejections.  
3. **Notary** *(if needed)* → **SDM (Delhi)** or **State Home Dept** *(as required)*  
4. **MEA Apostille** — **Sticker** or **e-Apostille (QR)**  
5. **Instant digital share** — scan/e-Apostille PDF + verification link  
6. **Secure return** — insured, tracked delivery of originals

---

## Timelines

Most marriage-certificate apostilles complete in **~2–3 working days** once documents are in process.  
If the receiving authority demands **State Home Department** (not SDM) or you need a **fresh reprint/translation**, timelines may extend; we’ll share your **firm ETA** upfront.

---

## Original vs Copy

- Family/dependent visa and civil offices **often require the original** with **Sticker**.  
- If the authority **accepts e-Apostille**, a **scan/notarized copy** may be enough and easier to reuse.  
- We always follow the **recipient’s written requirement** to avoid delays.

---

## Special Cases

- **Court marriage / Arya Samaj:** Valid **only with** the **Marriage Registration Certificate**. Ceremony certificates can be attached as supporting documents.  
- **Name/surname change after marriage:** We guide on **affidavit** vs **Gazette** vs **municipal correction**.  
- **Old/faded certificate:** Get a **fresh reprint** from municipal records before apostille for best acceptance.  
- **Couple abroad:** A parent/relative can submit locally with authorization.

---

## Delivery & Tracking

- **Premium pickup & return** (included where serviceable)  
- **Proactive updates** at every milestone  
- **Tamper-proof packaging** + **tracking ID** on dispatch

---

## How to Start

1. **Send a scan** of your Marriage Registration Certificate + the recipient’s requirement.  
2. Receive your **route, all-inclusive price, and ETA**.  
3. **Schedule pickup**, track progress, and get your apostilled certificate—**securely packed**.
