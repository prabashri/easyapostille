    question: "Do degree certificates require HRD or is SDM enough?",
    answer: "Many States/recipients prefer HRD/Education Department for degrees; some accept SDM. We always follow the destination's written checklist and your State rules, then confirm the shortest compliant route.",
    speakable: true
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to send the original degree certificate?",
    answer: "No, not necessary. It depends on your recipient's requirements. Sticker apostille often needs the original. If the recipient allows, e-Apostille on a notarized copy keeps your original safe—useful when documents may be retained."
  },
  {
    question: "Is e-Sanad available for my university?",
    answer: "If your University/Board is on e-Sanad, we'll prefer that digital route. Some institutions still charge a separate genuineness fee; timelines and fees vary."
  },
  {
    question: "Provisional vs final degree—what should I apostille?",
    answer: "Follow the recipient's list. Most prefer the final degree; use provisional only when explicitly accepted or when the final is pending."
  },
  {
    question: "How long will it take to apostille degree certificate?",
    answer: "SDM route: typically ~2-3 working days once in process. HRD/e-Sanad: depends on State/university verification and may take longer. We share a firm ETA after review.",
    speakable: true
  },
  {
    question: "What does it cost for degree certificate apostille?",
    answer: `Our SDM bundle for many degree cases is ${inr(price('degreeSdmBundle') ?? price('sdmBundle'))} per document (Notary + SDM (Delhi) + MEA + premium delivery). If HRD/e-Sanad is required, we quote it separately after verifying your route. Prices current as of ${PRICES_LAST_UPDATED}.`
  },
  {
    question: "Name mismatch or old/faded print—problem?",
    answer: "Usually solvable. We'll recommend an affidavit, university correction, or fresh reprint before apostille."
  }

An **MEA apostille** makes your Indian **degree certificate** valid in **Hague Convention** countries. <Anchor href="https://easyapostille.in">EasyApostille</Anchor> selects the correct path based on your **State/university** and the **recipient's checklist**:

- **Sticker Apostille (General):** physical MEA sticker on the degree.  
- **e-Apostille (QR):** MEA digital apostille with QR verification—fast when scans/copies are accepted.  
- **e-Sanad:** if your university is listed, we prefer this official digital pipeline.

<CalloutBox type="cta-secondary">
 For **non-Hague** destinations, we also manage **Notary → HRD/SDM → MEA → Embassy/Consulate** legalization.
  <Anchor href="/resources/what-is-apostille-meaning-process-certificate/">Apostille vs Attestation</Anchor> and <Anchor href="/resources/hague-vs-non-hague-apostille-or-embassy-attestation/">Hague nations</Anchor> details to consider.
</CalloutBox>

## Fee Structure

- **EasyApostille SDM bundle — {inr(price("degreeSdmBundle") ?? price("sdmBundle"))} per document**.
  Includes **Notary + SDM (Delhi) + MEA apostille + premium pickup/return** (serviceable locations) with WhatsApp/email updates.  
- For **HRD/State Education** route (if required), we quote case-by-case.
- **Multi-document discount:** **5-10%** auto-applied.

**HRD route (when required):** quoted separately after we confirm your university/board verification (including any e-Sanad/genuineness fees).

**Optional add-ons:** 
- certified translations

## Documents Required

- **Degree certificate** (final; or provisional if allowed by recipient)  
- **Marksheet(s)** or **consolidated** (only if asked in the checklist)  
- **Passport** (first/last page) of the candidate  
- **University/Board verification** or **e-Sanad details** (if State requires)  
- **Notarized copy** only for copy/e-Apostille path (when permitted)

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Eligibility check** — share scans; we confirm **SDM vs HRD/e-Sanad** and **Sticker vs e-Apostille**.  
2. **Pickup/hand-in & verification** — we pre-check names, roll/USN, dates to avoid rejections.  
3. **Notary** *(if needed)* → **SDM (Delhi)** **or** **State HRD/Education** (or **e-Sanad** where available).  
4. **MEA Apostille** — Sticker or e-Apostille (QR).  
5. **Instant digital share** — scan/e-Apostille PDF + verification link.  
6. **Secure return** — insured, tracked delivery of originals.

## Timelines

- **SDM route:** generally **~2-3 working days** once in process.  
- **HRD/e-Sanad:** varies by State/university and their verification queues; we'll give you a **firm ETA** after review.

## Original vs Copy

- If the recipient **demands physical verification**, use **Sticker on the original degree**.  
- If they **accept e-Apostille**, consider a **notarized copy**—ideal when the original may be retained or you need it for other uses.  
- We always follow the **recipient's written requirement**.

## Special Cases

- **Provisional degree:** use only when the recipient accepts it or the final isn't issued yet.  
- **Old/faded degree:** request a **fresh university reprint** before apostille.  
- **Name change/mismatch:** we'll suggest **affidavit**, **Gazette**, or **university correction** (fastest compliant path).
- **Applying from abroad:** parents/guardians can submit with basic IDs and authorization.

## Delivery & Tracking

- **Premium pickup & return** (included where serviceable)  
- **Proactive WhatsApp/email updates** at each milestone  
- **Tamper-proof packaging** + live **tracking ID** on dispatch


## How to Start

1. **Send scans** of the degree (and marksheets if requested) + the recipient’s requirement.  
2. Receive your **route (SDM/HRD/e-Sanad), all-inclusive price, and ETA**.  
3. **Schedule pickup**, track progress, and receive your apostilled degree—**securely packed**.
