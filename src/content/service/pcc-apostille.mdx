    question: "Do I need to send my original PCC?",
    answer: "For Sticker apostille, many authorities require the original PCC. For e-Apostille (QR), a scan is often sufficient—after we confirm your destination’s checklist.",
    speakable: true
  },
  {
    question: "Is notarization required for PCC?",
    answer: "Original PCCs generally proceed without Notary. If using a true copy or soft copy print, Notary can be needed based on the recipient’s written acceptance."
  },
  {
    question: "Which PCC is acceptable for apostille?",
    answer: "PCC issued by Passport Seva Kendra (PSK), Police/Commissioner’s Office, or State authority is commonly accepted. We’ll check format, seals, and date before filing."
  },
  {
    question: "How long is PCC valid?",
    answer: "Validity is set by the recipient (often 6–12 months). Always follow the visa/university/employer’s written validity rule."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does PCC apostille take?",
    answer: "Many cases complete in ~2–3 working days once documents are in process. State route or reissue scenarios can add time; we provide a firm ETA upfront.",
    speakable: true
  },
  {
    question: "What if my PCC is older or has formatting issues?",
    answer: "We’ll advise whether a fresh PCC is better (date near filing, clean seals, readable QR/ref no.) to avoid rejections."
  },
  {
    question: "Is e-Apostille acceptable for PCC?",
    answer: "Yes, if the recipient accepts e-Apostille. It’s faster and shareable. If they demand physical verification, choose Sticker apostille."
  },
  {
    question: "Can someone apply on my behalf?",
    answer: "Yes. A parent/guardian/authorized person can submit with basic IDs and a short authorization letter (we provide a template)."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost?",
    answer: `Our handling for PCC apostille is ${inr(price('pccMeaApostille') ?? price('sdmBundle'))} per document (MEA apostille + premium delivery). Extras (affidavit/translation/State route) are quoted only if needed.`
  },
  {
    question: "How will I get updates?",
    answer: "You’ll receive an order ID with proactive WhatsApp/email updates at each step—verification, MEA apostille, and courier tracking."
  }

## Overview

An **apostille** from India’s **MEA** makes your **Police Clearance Certificate (PCC)** valid in **Hague Convention** countries. Choose the mode based on the recipient’s checklist:

- **Sticker Apostille (General):** physical MEA sticker on your PCC.  
- **e-Apostille (QR):** digital apostille with QR verification—fast and easy to share.

> For **non-Hague destinations**, we manage the full attestation chain: **Notary → State/SDM → MEA → Embassy/Consulate**.

---

## Fee Structure

**EasyApostille PCC — {inr(price('pccMeaApostille') ?? price('sdmBundle'))} per document**  
Includes **MEA apostille + premium return** (serviceable locations) with live status updates.  
**Multi-document discount:** **5–10%** off automatically.

**Add-ons (only if needed):**
- **State Home Department** route (if a country insists on State over SDM)  
- **Affidavits / translations** (case-by-case)  
- **Fresh PCC issuance guidance** (government fees at actuals)  
- **Embassy/Consulate attestation** for non-Hague countries

> You’ll receive a single, **all-inclusive quote** before payment—no hidden fees.

---

## Documents Required

- **PCC** (original or scan, as advised after eligibility check)  
- **Passport** (first/last page) of the applicant  
- **Authorization letter + ID** of submitter (if applying on behalf)  
- **Additional proof** only if required by destination (we’ll confirm)

**Accepted PCC types**
- **PSK** (Passport Seva Kendra) PCC  
- **Police/Commissioner’s Office** PCC  
- **State**‐issued PCC  
- **Notarized true copies** (only if recipient accepts copies)

---

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Eligibility check** — share a scan; we confirm **Sticker vs e-Apostille** and **original vs copy**.  
2. **Pickup/hand-in & verification** — we prep your file to avoid rejections.  
3. **Notary** *(only if your case/recipient needs it)*  
4. **SDM / State Home Department** *(as applicable to destination rules)*  
5. **MEA Apostille** — Sticker or e-Apostille (QR)  
6. **Instant digital share** — scan/e-Apostille PDF + verification link  
7. **Secure delivery** — tracked, insured return of originals

---

## Timelines

Most PCC apostilles complete in **~2–3 working days** once in process.  
State-specific routes or reissues may add time; we’ll share your **real ETA** upfront.

---

## Original vs Copy

- **Visa/immigration** offices often prefer the **original PCC with Sticker apostille**.  
- If the recipient **accepts e-Apostille**, a **scan/notarized copy** can be faster and reusable.  
- We always follow the **recipient’s written checklist** to avoid delays.

---

## Special Cases

- **Old/expired PCC:** we may recommend getting a **fresh PCC** before apostille for best acceptance.  
- **Format/QR issues:** ensure clear seals, signatures, and reference numbers.  
- **Applying from abroad:** a **parent/guardian/authorized person** can submit with basic IDs and authorization.

---

## Delivery & Tracking

- **Premium pickup & return** (included where serviceable)  
- **WhatsApp/email updates** at each milestone  
- **Tamper-proof packaging** + **tracking ID** on dispatch

## How to Start

1. **Send a scan** of your PCC + the recipient’s requirement.  
2. Get a **written route, all-inclusive price, and ETA**.  
3. **Schedule pickup**, track progress, and receive your apostilled PCC—**securely packed**.
