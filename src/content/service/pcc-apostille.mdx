    question: "What is the difference between RPO and General PCC apostille?",
    answer:
      "RPO/PSK PCCs go directly to MEA for apostille at ₹1000 (no Notary/SDM). Police or State-issued PCCs usually need Notary → SDM → MEA, priced at ₹2000."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to send my original PCC?",
    answer:
      "If your PCC is from RPO/PSK, the original is required for direct MEA apostille. For e-Apostille or copies, we confirm acceptance before filing.",
    speakable: true
  },
  {
    question: "Is notarization required for PCC?",
    answer:
      "Not needed for original RPO/PSK PCCs. Required only if you'sre submitting a true copy or a State/Police PCC that MEA doesn't accept directly."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does PCC apostille take?",
    answer:
      "RPO/PSK (direct MEA) usually completes in 2-3 working days. General (Notary + SDM + MEA) takes 3-5 days depending on State verification.",
    speakable: true
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost?",
    answer:
      `RPO/PSK PCC — ${inr(price('pccRpoMeaApostille'))}; General PCC — ${inr(price('pccMeaApostille'))}. Both include MEA apostille & premium delivery.`
  },
  {
    question: "Which PCCs are accepted for apostille?",
    answer:
      "PCCs issued by Passport Seva Kendra/RPO, Police/Commissioner's Office, or State authority are accepted after format and seal check."
  },
  {
    question: "Can someone apply on my behalf?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A parent, guardian, or authorized person can apply with ID proofs and a short authorization letter (template provided)."
  },
  {
    question: "Is e-Apostille accepted for PCC?",
    answer:
      "Yes, if your destination accepts digital verification. Choose Sticker apostille when physical stamping or in-person validation is required."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my PCC is older or unclear?",
    answer:
      "If your PCC is over 6 months old or missing clear seals/QR, we may suggest re-issue for faster acceptance and zero rejection risk."
  },
  {
    question: "How will I get updates?",
    answer:
      "We share your order ID with live WhatsApp and email updates during verification, MEA apostille, and courier dispatch."
  }

An **apostille** from India's **MEA** makes your **Police Clearance Certificate (PCC)** valid in **Hague Convention** countries. Choose the mode based on the recipient's checklist:

- **Sticker Apostille (General):** physical MEA sticker on your PCC.  
- **e-Apostille (QR):** digital apostille with QR verification—fast and easy to share.

## Fee Structure

**RPO/PSK (Direct MEA route):** ₹{inr(price('pccRpoMeaApostille'))} — no Notary/SDM required  
**General PCC (Notary + SDM + MEA):** ₹{inr(price('pccMeaApostille'))} — full attestation chain


**EasyApostille service includes**:
- Free premium return** (serviceable locations) with live status updates.  
- **Discount:** **510%** off automatically for 1+ documents.

**Add-ons (only if needed):**
- **State Home Department** route (if a country insists on State over SDM)  
- **Affidavits / translations** (case-by-case)  
- **Fresh PCC issuance guidance** (government fees at actuals)  
- **Embassy/Consulate attestation** for non-Hague countries

### Route decision (RPO vs General)

- **RPO/PSK PCC (original):** Usually **direct MEA apostille** — **no Notary/SDM**, so **lower handling fee**.  
- **Police/Commissioner/State PCC** or **print/true copy:** Often needs **Notary → SDM/State → MEA**, so **general fee** applies.  
- We always follow the **recipient's written checklist**; if State HRD is demanded, we use that path even for RPO PCC.

<CalloutBox type="cta-secondary" class="my-1">
  For **non-Hague destinations**, we also manage the attestation chain: **Notary → State/SDM → MEA → Embassy/Consulate**.

  <Anchor href="https://easyapostille.in">EasyApostille</Anchor> will provide you timely support throughout the process.
</CalloutBox>

## Documents Required

- **PCC** (original or scan, as advised after eligibility check)  
- **Passport** (first/last page) of the applicant  
- **Authorization letter + ID** of submitter (if applying on behalf)  
- **Additional proof** only if required by destination (we'll confirm)

**Accepted PCC types**
- **PSK** (Passport Seva Kendra) PCC  
- **Police/Commissioner's Office** PCC  
- **State**-issued PCC  
- **Notarized true copies** (only if recipient accepts copies)


## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Eligibility check** — share a scan; we confirm **Sticker vs e-Apostille** and **original vs copy**.  
2. **Pickup/hand-in & verification** — we prep your file to avoid rejections.  
3. **Notary** *(only if your case/recipient needs it)*  
4. **SDM / State Home Department** *(as applicable to destination rules)*  
5. **MEA Apostille** — Sticker or e-Apostille (QR)  
6. **Instant digital share** — scan/e-Apostille PDF + verification link  
7. **Secure delivery** — tracked, insured return of originals

## Timelines

Most PCC apostilles complete in **~2-3 working days** once in process. In some special cases, additional time may be needed.

State-specific routes or reissues may add time; we'll share your **real ETA** upfront.

## Original vs Copy

**Visa/immigration** offices often prefer the **original PCC with Sticker apostille**.  
Check this guide on <Anchor href="/resources/apostille-on-original-vs-copy-certificate-india/">**Apostille on Original vs Copy**</Anchor>.

## Special Cases

- **Old/expired PCC:** we may recommend getting a **fresh PCC** before apostille for best acceptance.  
- **Format/QR issues:** ensure clear seals, signatures, and reference numbers.  
- **Applying from abroad:** a **parent/guardian/authorized person** can submit with basic IDs and authorization.

## Delivery & Tracking

- **Premium pickup & return** (included where serviceable)  
- **WhatsApp/email updates** at each milestone  
- **Tamper-proof packaging** + **tracking ID** on dispatch

## How to Start

1. **Send a scan** of your PCC + the recipient's requirement.  
2. Get a **written route, all-inclusive price, and ETA**.  
3. **Schedule pickup**, track progress, and receive your apostilled PCC—**securely packed**.
