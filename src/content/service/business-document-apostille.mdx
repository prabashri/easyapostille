Apostille legalizes Indian **business documents** for use in **Hague Convention** countries. We support both modes:

- **Sticker Apostille (General):** physical MEA sticker on the document.  
- **e-Apostille (QR):** digital apostille with QR verification—fast, shareable, and widely accepted when allowed.

<CalloutBox type="info" class="mb-1">
  For **non-Hague** destinations, <Anchor href="https://easyapostille.in">EasyApostille manages</Anchor> the attestation chain: **Notary → Chamber of Commerce → MEA → Embassy/Consulate**.
</CalloutBox>

## Accepted Documents (Registered Companies in India)

- **Power of Attorney (Company POA)**

<CalloutBox type="cta-secondary" class="mb-1">
  Unsure about your document type? Share a scan and the recipient's checklist — we'll confirm the route and acceptance.
</CalloutBox>

## Fee Guide (transparent components)

- **Chamber of Commerce (CoC) attestation:** **{inr(price('cocPerPage'))} per page**  
- **MEA fee + handling:** depends on document type, page count, and destination rules  
- **Embassy/Consulate (non-Hague):** destination-wise charges (if required)

**Important:** Business documents vary widely. **Contact us for a complete quote before you proceed.** You'll receive a **written route, all-inclusive price, and ETA**.

## Documents Required (typical)

- The **business document** (POA / MOA / AOA / Incorporation / Invoice / etc.)  
- **Company KYC**: CIN / GST / PAN copy (as applicable)  
- **Authorized signatory ID** (passport/ID)  
- **Board Resolution / Authorization letter** (if POA/authorization involved)  
- **Covering letter** (we'll template this, if needed)

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Eligibility check** — share a scan; we confirm **Sticker vs e-Apostille** and original vs copy.  
2. **Pickup/hand-in & verification** — we prep your file to avoid rejections.  
3. **Notary** *(as applicable to doc type)*  
4. **Chamber of Commerce (CoC)** attestation  
5. **MEA Apostille** — Sticker or e-Apostille (QR)  
6. **Instant digital share** — scan/e-Apostille PDF + verification link  
7. **Secure delivery** — tracked, insured return of originals

## Timelines

Most business-document apostilles complete in **~2-3 working days** once in process. Page count, CoC checks, and non-Hague legalizations can add time—**we provide a firm ETA up front.**

## Originals vs Copies (quick rules)

- **Invoices/Commercial docs** can often work from good scans for **e-Apostille (QR)** if accepted.  
- **POA / MOA / AOA / Incorporation** are typically **originals** for Sticker routes.  
- Always follow the **recipient's written checklist** to avoid delays.

## Delivery & Tracking

- **Pan-India pickup & secure return** (where serviceable)  
- **Proactive WhatsApp/email updates** at each milestone  
- **Tamper-proof packaging** + **tracking ID** on dispatch

## How to Start

1. **Send scans** of your document + the recipient's requirement.  
2. Get a **written route, all-inclusive price, and ETA**.  
3. **Schedule pickup**, track progress, and receive your apostilled documents—**securely packed**.
