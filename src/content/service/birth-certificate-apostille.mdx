    question: "Do I need to send my original birth certificate?",
    answer: "No, not necessary. Absolutely, its your choice. You can choose on apostille on original or copy based on your requirements. Sometimes, to verify the copy, you may need to send the original birth certificate for confirmation.",
    speakable: true
  },
  {
    question: "Is notarization required for birth certificates?",
    answer: "Municipal originals usually don't need Notary. Notary applies when using a true copy or when we add an affidavit for name/date corrections."
  },
  {
    question: "There's a minor name/date mismatch—can I still apostille it?",
    answer: "Yes in most cases. We'll advise the simplest path: affidavit vs municipal reissue so the apostille matches your passport/records."
  },
  {
    question: "My birth certificate is very old—will it be accepted?",
    answer: "Often yes. If fields are missing or faded, we recommend getting a reissued copy from municipal records before apostille."
  },
  {
    question: "Can parents apply on behalf of a child birth certificate who is abroad?",
    answer: "Yes. Parents/guardians can submit with basic IDs and a short authorization letter (we'll share a template)."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to apostille a birth certificate?",
    answer: "Many cases complete in ~2-3 working days once documents are in process. State route and reissues can add time; we share a firm ETA up front.",
    speakable: true
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost for birth certificate apostille?",
    answer: `Our standard SDM bundle for many birth-certificate cases is ${inr(price('birthSdmBundle') ?? price('sdmBundle'))} per document (Notary + SDM (Delhi) + MEA + premium delivery). Any State-route requirement or extras (affidavit/translation) are quoted only if needed.`

An **apostille** from India's **MEA** makes your birth certificate valid in **Hague Convention** countries. Choose the mode that fits your recipient's checklist:

- **Sticker Apostille (General):** a physical MEA sticker on the document.  
- **e-Apostille (QR):** a digital apostille with QR verification—fast, shareable, and widely accepted.

## Fee Structure

- **EasyApostille bundle — {inr(price('birthSdmBundle') ?? price('sdmBundle'))} per document**  
- Includes **Notary + SDM (Delhi) + MEA apostille + premium return** (serviceable locations) with live status updates.  
- For **State Home Dept** route (if recipient insists), we quote case-by-case. 
- **Multi-document discount:** **5-10%** off automatically.

**Add-ons (only if needed):**
- State **Home Department** route (if a country insists on State over SDM)  
- **Affidavits / translations / name-mismatch fixes**  
- **Municipal reissue** support (government fees at actuals)  
- **Embassy/Consulate attestation** for non-Hague countries

<CalloutBox type="info" class="my-1">
  Birth certificate is a <Anchor href="/services/personal-documents-apostille/">**personal document**</Anchor>. For MEA apostille, either <Anchor href="/resources/document-authentication-india-coc-hrd-vs-sdm-home-state-attestation/">**SDM or State Home Department**</Anchor> pre-auth is needed depending on your State and recipient's rules.

  _You'll receive a single, **all-inclusive quote** before payment—no hidden fees._

## Documents Required

- **Birth certificate** (scan or original, as advised after eligibility check)  
- **Passport** (first/last page) of the person named on the certificate  
- **Parent/guardian ID** (when applying on behalf)  
- **Affidavit/correction proof** only if name/date mismatch exists

**Accepted certificate types**

- Municipal/corporation/panchayat **originals**  
- **Reissued/duplicate** copies from municipal records  
- **Hospital-issued** certificates **with municipal endorsement**  
- **Notarized true copies** (when the recipient accepts copies)

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Eligibility check** — share a scan; we confirm **Sticker vs e-Apostille** and **original vs copy**.  
2. **Pickup/hand-in & verification** — we prep your file to avoid rejections.  
3. **Notary** *(if required for your case)*  
4. **SDM / State Home Department** *(as applicable to destination rules)*  
5. **MEA Apostille** — Sticker or e-Apostille (QR)  
6. **Instant digital share** — scan/e-Apostille PDF + verification link  
7. **Secure delivery** — tracked, insured return of originals

## Timelines

Most birth-certificate apostilles complete in **~2-3 working days** once in process.  
State-specific routes or reissues may add time; we'll share your **real ETA** upfront.

## Original vs Copy

- **Civil/visa offices** often prefer the **original with Sticker apostille**.  
- If the recipient **accepts e-Apostille**, a **scan/notarized copy** can be faster and easier to reuse.  
- We always follow the **recipient's written checklist** to avoid delays.

## Special Cases

- **Name/date mismatch:** simple **affidavit** vs **municipal reissue**—we recommend the fastest compliant path.  
- **Old/faded certificate:** get a **fresh municipal reprint** before apostille for best acceptance.  
- **Applying from abroad:** **parents/guardians** can submit with basic IDs and authorization.

## Delivery & Tracking

- **Premium pickup & return** (included where serviceable)  
- **WhatsApp/email updates** at each milestone  
- **Tamper-proof packaging** + **tracking ID** on dispatch

## How to Start

1. **Send a scan** of your birth certificate + the recipient's requirement.  
2. Get a **written route, all-inclusive price, and ETA**.  
3. **Schedule pickup**, track progress, and receive your apostilled document—**securely packed**.
