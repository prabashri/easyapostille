    question: "Do marksheets need HRD or is SDM enough?",
    answer: "Many States prefer HRD/Education Department for higher-education documents. Some recipients accept SDM. We always follow the destination’s written checklist and your State’s rules.",
    speakable: true
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to send original marksheets?",
    answer: "For Sticker apostille, originals are common. When the recipient allows, e-Apostille on notarized copies can work and keeps your originals safe. We confirm before payment."
  },
  {
    question: "Is e-Sanad available for my university/board?",
    answer: "If your Board/University is on e-Sanad, we’ll prefer that route. Some institutions still require paid genuineness—fees and timelines vary."
  },
  {
    question: "Which sheets should I apostille—semester-wise or consolidated?",
    answer: "Follow the receiving authority’s list. Many ask for degree + consolidated (or final semester). We’ll review and tell you the minimum valid set."
  },
  {
    question: "How long will it take?",
    answer: "SDM route: often ~2–3 working days once in process. HRD route: depends on State/university verification and can take longer. You’ll get a firm ETA after review.",
    speakable: true
  },
  {
    question: "What does it cost?",
    answer: `Our SDM bundle for many marksheet cases is ${inr(price('marksheetSdmBundle') ?? price('sdmBundle'))} per document (Notary + SDM (Delhi) + MEA + premium delivery). If HRD/e-Sanad is required, we quote it separately after verifying your route. Prices current as of ${PRICES_LAST_UPDATED}.`
  },
  {
    question: "Lost/damaged marksheet—can I use a duplicate?",
    answer: "Yes, if it’s a reissued/duplicate from your Board/University. We’ll tell you whether a fresh reprint is recommended before apostille."
  }

Need to submit marksheets abroad? An **MEA apostille** makes Indian educational documents valid in **Hague Convention** countries. We’ll pick the right path based on your **State/university** and the **recipient’s checklist**:

- **Sticker Apostille (General):** physical MEA sticker on the document.  
- **e-Apostille (QR):** digital apostille with MEA QR verification (faster when scans are accepted).  
- **e-Sanad:** if your Board/University is listed, we prefer this official digital pipeline.

> For **non-Hague** destinations, we manage **Notary → HRD/SDM → MEA → Embassy/Consulate** legalization.



## Fee Structure

**EasyApostille SDM bundle — {inr(price('marksheetSdmBundle') ?? price('sdmBundle'))} per document**  
Includes **Notary + SDM (Delhi) + MEA apostille + premium pickup/return** with WhatsApp/email updates.  
**Multi-document discount:** **5–10%** auto-applied.

**HRD route** (when required by your State or recipient): priced **separately** after we confirm university/board verification needs (including any e-Sanad/genuineness fees).  
**Add-ons (only if needed):** translations, affidavits/name fixes, municipal/university reissues, Embassy legalization (non-Hague).

<small>Prices current as of {PRICES_LAST_UPDATED}. You’ll receive one **all-inclusive quote** before payment—no hidden add-ons.</small>

## Documents Required

- **Marksheet(s)** — semester-wise **and/or** consolidated, as per the recipient’s checklist  
- **Degree/Provisional certificate** (if listed)  
- **Passport** (first/last page) of the candidate  
- **University/Board verification** or **e-Sanad details** (if your State requires)  
- **Notarized copy** only when we use the copy/e-Apostille path

---

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Eligibility check** — share scans; we confirm **SDM vs HRD vs e-Sanad**, and **Sticker vs e-Apostille**, per the recipient’s requirement.  
2. **Pickup/hand-in & verification** — we prep the file to avoid rejections (spellings, roll/USN, dates).  
3. **Notary** *(if needed)* → **SDM (Delhi)** **or** **State HRD/Education** (or **e-Sanad** where available).  
4. **MEA Apostille** — Sticker or e-Apostille (QR).  
5. **Instant digital share** — scan/e-Apostille PDF + verification link.  
6. **Secure return** — insured, tracked delivery of originals.

---

## Timelines

- **SDM route:** typically **~2–3 working days** once in process.  
- **HRD route:** depends on State/university verification; timelines vary (we’ll share a **firm ETA** after review).  
- **e-Sanad:** fastest for supported institutions; some still add genuineness fees.

---

## Original vs Copy

- If the destination **demands physical verification**, choose **Sticker on original**.  
- If they **accept e-Apostille**, a **notarized copy** (or scan) may suffice and keeps your originals free.  
- We always follow the **recipient’s written checklist** to avoid delays.

---

## Special Cases

- **Backlog/faded print:** get a **fresh university/board reprint** before apostille.  
- **Name changes/mismatch:** quick **affidavit** vs formal **university correction**—we’ll advise the fastest compliant route.  
- **Transcript/Bonafide/Medium-of-Instruction:** also supported (apostille or e-Sanad where available).

---

## Delivery & Tracking

- **Premium pickup & return** (included where serviceable)  
- **Proactive WhatsApp/email updates** at each milestone  
- **Tamper-proof packaging** + live **tracking ID** on dispatch

---

## How to Start

1. **Send scans** of your marksheets/degree + the recipient’s requirements.  
2. Receive your **route (SDM/HRD/e-Sanad), all-inclusive price, and ETA**.  
3. **Schedule pickup**, track progress, and receive your apostilled documents—**securely packed**.
