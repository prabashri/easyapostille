faq:
  - question: "Which affidavits can be apostilled?"
    answer: "Common types include POA for property/visa, name change, relationship, and general declarations. Share a scan and we’ll confirm eligibility and the correct attestation route."
    speakable: true
  - question: "Do I need stamp paper and Notary before apostille?"
    answer: "Yes—affidavits must be executed correctly (proper stamp paper or franking) and notarized. We’ll guide you and arrange SDM/State attestation if required."
  - question: "Are scans enough or do I need originals?"
    answer: "For e-Apostille, scans may be acceptable in many cases. For sticker apostille, originals are typically needed. We confirm after eligibility review."
  - question: "Can a POA signed in India be used abroad after apostille?"
    answer: "Yes—apostille certifies the Notary/SDM authentication for use in Hague-member countries. Some consulates still prefer sticker; we’ll advise."
  - question: "Who should sign and where?"
    answer: "Sign in presence of the Notary (and witnesses if required). We’ll share the correct format and execution checklist."
  - question: "How long does affidavit apostille take?"
    answer: "Often 2–3 working days after acceptance; complex POA cases may vary. We’ll quote a real ETA before payment."
  - question: "How do I receive the documents?"
    answer: "You’ll receive a scan or e-Apostille PDF + verification link and tracked courier delivery for originals."
