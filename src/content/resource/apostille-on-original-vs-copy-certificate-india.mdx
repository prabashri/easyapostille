faq:
  - question: "Do I need the original certificate for apostille in India?"
    answer: "Often yes for personal/civil records (birth, marriage). For PCC/medical—because they're short-validity—apostille the original if the document will be returned. If an authority may keep long-validity documents (like degrees), apostille a notarized copy instead—if allowed."
    speakable: true

  - question: "Can educational documents be apostilled on copies?"
    answer: "Frequently yes. Many universities/employers accept apostilled notarized or HRD-attested copies of degrees and marksheets. If the checklist insists on originals, follow that."

  - question: "Are commercial documents apostilled on originals or copies?"
    answer: "Mostly on notarized or Chamber-attested copies (POA, invoices, CoO, board resolutions). Originals are rarely required and often kept in company records."

  - question: "Is e-Apostille possible with scanned copies?"
    answer: "In many cases, yes. Clear scans can be used for an e-Apostille with QR verification that Hague countries widely accept. Always confirm your recipient's preference."

  - question: "Which visa applications need original apostille?"
    answer: "Family/dependent visas commonly require apostilled originals of marriage and birth certificates. Student/work cases often accept apostilled copies of degrees/marksheets. PCC/medical (short-validity) are typically apostilled on originals when they'll be returned."

When you start the <Anchor href="/resources/what-is-apostille-meaning-process-certificate/">apostille process</Anchor>, the most important question is:  
**“Do I need an apostille on the original or on a copy?”**

Quick answer:

* If the document has a **short validity period** (PCC/medical) and **will be returned after submission**, <Anchor href="/resources/how-to-get-apostille-in-india-step-by-step/">get apostille affixed to the original</Anchor>.  
* If the document has a **long validity period** (graduation, marriage, birth) and **may not be returned**, get the **apostille affixed to a copy** (often e-Apostille (QR)).

In practice, your choice depends on document type, the regulations of the destination country and whether you use a sticker or an e-Apostille.   
Let's take a closer look.

## How to decide (3 factors that are important)

1. Type of document  
* **Personal:** birth/marriage/death, PCC, medical documents, affidavits  
* **Educational:** Degree, diploma, grade sheets, transcripts  
* **Business:** POA, contracts, invoices, CoO, board resolutions  
2. Regulations of the destination country (college, embassy, employer, immigration authority)  
* Some insist on an apostille on the original.  
* Others accept notarized copies with an apostille- especially if the originals are retained.  
3. Type of apostille  
* **Sticker apostille**: physical sticker on the original.  
* **e-Apostille (QR):** digital apostille from scans; widely accepted in the Hague countries (but check if your recipient prefers a sticker).

## When you need to apostille the original the certificate/document

Choose **stickers on the original** if:

* The recipient specifies this in their checklist (university/employer/immigration).  
* They must check the security features (embossing, watermark) with the sticker.  
* The office is known to refuse copies or only keep certified originals.  
* The documents are only valid for a short period of time.

Common examples

* **PCC** for background checks (valid for 3-6 months). In this case, the police clearance certificate is only issued for a unique reason. For example, a PCC for immigration to the country.  
* **Medical certificates**/vaccination certificates. These are usually only valid for 1-3 months and are required for a specific purpose.  
* Some **university admissions** require apostilled original degrees/grades.  
* **Immigration**/registration offices for family documents (birth/marriage).  
* **Work visas** where the HR department insists on an original apostilled degree to verify authenticity.

**Pros:** generally understandable; fewer queries later.  
**Cons:** Your original leaves your hands; **reissue may take some time** if kept.

**Note on provisional certificates**: Many universities treat provisional transcripts at deadlines like graduation and may require an apostille on the original provisional transcript. Always follow the recipient's written instructions.

## When to apostille a photocopy (copy)

Choose the apostille on a copy (often e-Apostille) if:

* The document has a **long validity** (e.g. graduation, marriage/birth) and the authority is likely to keep it.  
* You need to **keep the original** for later use/verification.  
* The recipient expressly accepts apostilled copies.

Common examples

* Many **embassies require educational documents** to be presented for visa applications. In this case, you must keep the original. So do it on photocopies.  
* **Personal documents** such as birth/marriage certificates must be presented to confirm your identity. The apostille on photocopies is therefore the better option.  
* **Business documents** (contracts/POA), the originals of which remain in the company's files.

**Pros:** protects your original; often faster; easy QR verification.  
**Cons:** some authorities still insist on a **sticker on the original-** confirm it first.

## Quick Guide — Original vs Copy

<Table caption="Apostille on Original vs Copy: Document Type Guide">
| Document type / case | Safer choice | Why |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Degree certificate** | **Copies (sticker) Copies (e-apostille) Original (Sticker)** | Commonly required for university/employer scrutiny. |
| **Marksheets / Transcripts** | **Copies (sticker) Copies (e-apostille) Original (Sticker)** | Copies often accepted; sealed transcripts may be separate. |
| **PCC** | **Original (Sticker) Copy (sticker)** | Short validity and raise only for certain purpose |
| **Medical/Fitness** | **Original (Sticker) Copy (sticker)** | Short validity; QR is enough for verification. |
| **Birth / Marriage / Death** | **Copies (sticker) Copies (e-apostille) Original (Sticker)** | Civil/immigration offices often demand originals. |
| **Affidavits (name change/single-status)** | **Copies (sticker) Copies (e-apostille) Original (Sticker)** | Mostly accessible as public documents |
| **Commercial (POA, CoO, invoices, board resolutions)** | **Copy (sticker) Copies (e-apostille)** | Businesses usually apostille true copies; originals remain on record. |

## Practical advice for visa applications

* **Student Visa (EU/US):** Universities often accept **apostilled copies** of marksheets/transcripts; embassies may require **original PCC** or **original birth certificate**.  
* **Work Visa (Middle East):** Employers typically want **apostilled original degree** \+ **original PCC**.  
* **Dependent/Family Visa:** Many posts require **apostilled original marriage** and **original birth** certificates.  
* **Business/Trade:** **Apostilled copies** of **POA/invoices/CoO** are usually fine—no need to risk originals.

**Country & authority rules change.** Always read the latest checklist from your recipient.

## Key takeaways

* **Check the checklist first.** If it says “apostille on original,” don't send a copy.  
* As a rule of thumb: **personal/civil → originals**, **educational/commercial → copies often fine** (but verify).  
* **e-Apostille (QR)** can be faster and safer where accepted.  
* If you're unsure, **share a scan**—we'll confirm **scan vs notarized copy vs original** **before** you proceed.
