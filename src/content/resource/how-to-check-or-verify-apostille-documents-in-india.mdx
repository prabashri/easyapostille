faq:
  - question: "How do I verify an e-Apostille in India?"
    answer: "Open the PDF and scan the QR using your phone. The verification page should show your name, document type/number, issue date, and the issuing authority. Match these with your document."
    speakable: true
  - question: "The QR link doesn’t open—what should I do?"
    answer: "Try another network/browser and ensure the full URL is loaded. If it still fails, request the verification URL from the issuer or your service provider and cross-check the hash/ID on the PDF."
  - question: "How do I check a physical sticker apostille?"
    answer: "Confirm the apostille number, country, date, issuing authority (MEA), and signature/seal. Details on the sticker must match the attached document. Look for erasures, overlays, or mismatched names."
  - question: "Can I check apostille status online?"
    answer: "For e-Apostille, the QR page reflects issuance. For sticker apostille, ask your provider for tracking updates; some queues and state routes don’t expose public status portals."
  - question: "What are common red flags of a fake apostille?"
    answer: "Misspelled names, inconsistent dates, low-quality or misaligned stickers, QR leading to unrelated pages, and unverifiable authority details. When in doubt, request the official verification link."
  - question: "Does apostille have an expiry date?"
    answer: "The apostille certifies authenticity and doesn’t expire, but the receiving authority may impose document-age limits (e.g., PCC validity). Always check destination rules."
  - question: "Is the verification process different for non-Hague countries?"
    answer: "Non-Hague destinations need embassy attestation instead of apostille. Verification is via embassy/consulate stamps and their records rather than MEA apostille QR/sticker."

## Verify e-Apostille (QR)
1. Open your **e-Apostille PDF**.  
2. **Scan the QR** code using your phone camera.  
3. Confirm the **name**, **document info**, **issue date**, and **issuing authority** on the official page.  
4. Save the **verification link** with your records.

## Verify Sticker Apostille
Check that the **MEA sticker**:
- is affixed and **undamaged**,
- shows correct **name/document details**,
- carries the **seal/signature** and issue date,
- matches your **document’s identity** (degree number, certificate no., etc.).

> When submitting to an authority, include a **scan of the sticker page** along with the document.

---

## Common Red Flags
- QR leads to a page where the data **doesn’t match** your document.  
- Sticker is **peeled, re-pasted** or shows tampering.  
- Details on apostille and document **don’t align** (name, dates, numbers).  
- Unusual payment requests to personal accounts after you’ve received an order ID—**talk to us** before paying anything new.
