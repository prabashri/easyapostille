faq:
  - question: "How do I know if my destination is a Hague country?"
    answer: "Check the official HCCH Apostille list and search your destination. If it’s listed, apostille applies; if not, you’ll need embassy/consulate attestation. When in doubt, ask the recipient for their written policy."
    speakable: true
  - question: "Apostille vs Embassy—what’s faster?"
    answer: "Apostille is typically quicker (often 2–4 working days once in process) because it skips embassy legalization. Embassy/consulate attestation can add days to weeks depending on the country."
  - question: "Does apostille expire?"
    answer: "The apostille doesn’t expire, but recipients (universities, visa offices, employers) may ask for recent issuance—often within 6–12 months."
  - question: "What if my document is digital—can I do e-Apostille?"
    answer: "Many documents can be e-apostilled via the e-Sanad portal. Some still require verification or physical routes first; we confirm this during the eligibility check."
  - question: "Do commercial documents follow the same route?"
    answer: "Commercial documents commonly require Chamber of Commerce (CoC) before MEA apostille or embassy legalization. We confirm the exact route after reviewing your file and recipient’s checklist."

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Rule of thumb:** If the destination is a **Hague member**, start <Anchor href="/resources/what-is-apostille-meaning-process-certificate/">**apostille process**</Anchor>. If it's **not**, do **embassy legalization**.
</CalloutBox>

## How to check if your destination is a Hague member

1. Open the official list on the **HCCH (Hague Conference)** website.  
2. Search your **destination country/territory**.  
3. If it’s listed, you’re under the **Apostille Convention**.  
4. Cross-check with your **recipient’s written policy** (visa office, university, employer, registry).

<CalloutBox type="note" heading="Heads-up">
Membership and rules can change. Always rely on the **current HCCH list** and the **recipient’s written requirement** for your case.
</CalloutBox>

## Sticker Apostille vs e-Apostille (QR)

- **Sticker Apostille**: A physical sticker affixed by the **MEA** or its branch secretariat.  
- **e-Apostille (QR)**: A **digitally signed** apostille with **QR code** for verification (via **e-Sanad**).

<CalloutBox type="info" heading="Which one should I use?">
Use the one your recipient accepts.  
If they allow **e-Apostille**, it’s often **faster** and easy to share. If they demand **physical verification**, go with the **Sticker**.
</CalloutBox>

## Which pre-verification applies in India?

**By document type (general guidance):**
- **Educational** → Notary (as needed) → **HRD**/**University** route → MEA  
- **Personal** (birth, marriage, PCC, affidavits) → Notary (as needed) → **SDM/Home Dept** → MEA  
- **Commercial/Business** (POA, MOA/AOA, Incorporation, Invoices) → Notary (as needed) → **Chamber of Commerce (CoC)** → MEA

<CalloutBox type="warning" heading="Important">
States, universities, and recipients can enforce **their own pre-checks**. We confirm your exact route during the **eligibility review**—before any payment.
</CalloutBox>

## Embassy/Consulate Attestation (Non-Hague)

If your destination isn’t in the Hague list, the flow typically becomes:

1. Notary (if required) → **SDM/Home/HRD/CoC** (as applicable)  
2. **MEA** (authentication)  
3. **Embassy/Consulate legalization** of the destination country  
4. Sometimes **MOFA** at the destination as the final step

Embassy steps may add **appointments**, **format checks**, and extra **fees/timelines**. We share a written **route + quote + ETA** before you start.
