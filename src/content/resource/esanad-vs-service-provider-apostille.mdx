faq:
  - question: "When should I use e-Sanad?"
    answer: "When your document category/state is supported and you’re comfortable applying yourself. Many education documents are eligible."
  - question: "When is a service provider faster?"
    answer: "Mixed cases, state pre-auth (HRD/SDM) requirements, courier logistics, or urgent timelines often benefit from a provider."
  - question: "Is the apostille different?"
    answer: "No—the MEA apostille is the same (sticker or e-Apostille QR). The difference is application workflow and speed."
