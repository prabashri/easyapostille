If you are planning to **study, work, or settle abroad**, or are an **NRI living in a foreign country**, you may have come across the term **apostille**. But what exactly does it mean, why is it required, and how do you get an apostille for your documents?

This guide by <Anchor href="https://easyapostille.in">EasyApostille</Anchor> explains the **meaning of apostille, its process in India, and certificate details**, so you know exactly what to expect.

## What is Apostille?

An **apostille** is a form of **document authentication** issued under the <Anchor href="https://www.hcch.net/en/home">**Hague Convention of 1961**</Anchor>, which abolished the need for embassy legalization of public documents.

In simple terms, an apostille is a **stamp or sticker** placed on your documents by the designated authority that confirms the document is <u>genuine</u> and valid for use in **Hague Convention member countries**.

* **Number of countries:** <Anchor href="https://www.hcch.net/en/states/hcch-members">92 members (in 2025)</Anchor>. 
* <Anchor href="https://www.hcch.net/en/states/authorities/details3/?aid=643">**Competent authority in India**</Anchor>: <Anchor href="https://www.mea.gov.in/apostille-menu.htm">Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)</Anchor>.

## Apostille Meaning in India

In India, apostille is often called **apostille attestation**. It is mandatory for various situations such as:

* **Job seekers:** seeking employment in foreign companies.  
* **Families:** migrating for reunification, marriage, or adoption.  
* **Businesses:** expanding operations internationally.  
* **NRIs:** confirming that documents originated in India.

üëâ For **Hague Convention countries**, apostille is valid. For **non-Hague countries**, you will need **embassy attestation** instead following the apostille process.

## What Does an Apostille Look Like?

An apostille is usually a **square-shaped sticker** (approximately 9x9 cm) affixed to the back of your document.

It must contains the below <Anchor href="https://www.hcch.net/en/publications-and-studies/details4/?pid=7069&dtid=28">details approved by Hague Conference on Private International Law</Anchor> (HCCH)
