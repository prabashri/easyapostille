    answer: "Quotes usually include the pre-attestation your document needs (Notary/SDM/HRD/CoC), outsourced-center handling, professional checks, GST, and courier. That's why realistic totals often land between ₹1,500 and ₹6,000+ depending on route.",

    question: "Is e-Apostille cheaper than Sticker apostille?",
    answer: "MEA fee is similar. e-Apostille can reduce logistics when scans are accepted. If originals and SDM/HRD are required, those steps drive the total regardless of Sticker vs e-Apostille.",
    speakable: true
  },  
  {
    question: "Can I do only the MEA apostille with SDM-attested documents?",
    answer: `Yes. You pay the MEA govt fee (₹50/₹90) + our MEA handling (${inr(price('meaApostille'))}) + any logistics (if applicable).`
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer discounts for multiple documents?",
    answer: "Yes—typical slabs are 5% off for 2-5 documents and 10% off for 5+ documents, applied per document for bundle orders. Your final quote reflects these savings."

## Apostille Price in India — What It Really Costs

Getting a document apostilled in India can feel pricey and confusing. You'll often see quotes that look much higher than the official **MEA fee of ₹50 or ₹90** per document.

Why is there such a difference in cost?

In short, agencies include charges for **notary, pre-attestation (Notary/SDM/HRD/CoC)** required for MEA apostille submission, as well as additional fees for **handling and logistics**.

Not sure which pre-attestation you need? See our guide: <Anchor href="/resources/document-authentication-india-coc-hrd-vs-sdm-home-state-attestation/">**HRD vs SDM vs Home Dept vs CoC**, for the MEA apostille of your document</Anchor>.

This page explains every component and shows **realistic totals** you can expect.

## Official MEA Apostille Fee

* **MEA government fee:** **₹50 / ₹90 per document** (category-dependent)  
* This is **only** the government fee for issuing the apostille. It does **not** include Notary, SDM/HRD/CoC, agency handling, or courier.

<BlockQuote citeUrl="https://www.mea.gov.in/apostille-menu.htm" citeName="Ministry of External Affairs, India" date="Sep 27, 2025" sourceTitle="Fees for Apostille and Normal Attestation">
A fee of Rs 50 is payable for Apostille of document. (W.e.f 21 December 2016, payment by means of postal orders has been discontinued.) Normal Attestation is done free of cost.  
The fee chargeable by the outsourced agencies per document for its collection and delivery for Apostille/normal attestation by MEA will be Rs. 84/- (Service Fee) and Rs 3 per page (Scanning Fee).  
</BlockQuote>

## Additional Components of Apostille Pricing

When agencies quote **₹1,700-₹6,000** (or more) per document, they're usually bundling steps **beyond** the MEA fee:

1. **Notary attestation:** starts around **₹100** (varies by office & doc type). Some centers list \~**₹160**/doc.  
2. **State/Home Dept (“State attestation”):** \~**₹500 - ₹6,750+** (varies by State).  
3. **HRD (education):** \~**₹2,500 - ₹24,000** depending on State/university verification. Even on **e-Sanad**, some universities charge separate genuineness (often **₹500-₹4,500**).  
4. **SDM attestation:** \~**₹500 - ₹2,500** for verification/service in many places; packaged Delhi SDM routes are often quoted around **₹4,110**.  
5. **Chamber of Commerce (CoC) attestation** - commercial docs: now commonly ₹400-₹450 per page (attested page count).
6. **Professional handling:** document checks, forms, queues, status updates, GST.  
7. **Courier / pickup & return:** varies by location/urgency.

Prices above are **indicative** and can change by provider, city, workload, and taxes.

To avoid confusion, Easyapotille bundles all the processes \[Notary \+ SDM (Delhi) \+ MEA Apostille \+ Logistics\] for {inr(price('sdmBundle'))} and offers discounts for multiple documents.

**EasyApostille one-price option**

* **Bundle:** **Notary \+ SDM (Delhi) \+ MEA Apostille \+ logistics**  
* **Price:** **{inr(price('sdmBundle'))} per document**  
* **Discounts:** **5-10%** for multiple docs  
* **HRD / CoC:** quoted separately if your case needs them

## Why choose EasyApostille ({inr(price('sdmBundle'))} all-inclusive SDM bundle)

We optimize the entire chain—**Notary → SDM (Delhi) → MEA Apostille**—by coordinating submissions through **MEA-authorized outsourced partner centers**. That means fewer trips, fewer surprises, and a consistent, standards-based outcome.

### What you get for {inr(price('sdmBundle'))} per document

* **Notary attestation** (true copy/affidavit as applicable)  
* **SDM pre-attestation (Delhi SDM)**  
* **MEA Apostille** (Sticker/e-Apostille as applicable)  
* **Premium return** to your address in serviceable locations (Pickup available in many locations for an extra charge) 
* **Status updates** (WhatsApp/email) \+ clear, itemized invoice  
* **5-10% multi-document discount** applied automatically

**HRD/CoC when needed:** If your case requires **HRD** (education) or **Chamber of Commerce** (commercial), we confirm the requirement first and add that piece at actuals—**only after your approval**.

### How we make it easier (and more reliable)

1. **Route check before you pay** - Send a scan \+ destination checklist; we confirm **original vs copy** and **SDM vs HRD vs CoC**.  
2. **Seal-ready prep** - We verify names/dates, add affidavits if needed, and make sure **Notary/SDM seals** are legible (name, reg. no., date, place).  
3. **MEA-authorized counters** - Submissions/collections move through **authorized partner centers**, keeping the process standardized.  
4. **Fewer touchpoints** - One pickup, one return. You don't shuttle between offices.  
5. **Transparent pricing** - No hidden add-ons; anything extra (like HRD/CoC or out-of-coverage courier) is quoted up front.

### How to start (2 minutes)

1. **Share a scan** of your document and the recipient's instructions.  
2. Get a **written route \+ quote** (we won't proceed without your okay).  
3. **Schedule pickup**, track progress, and receive your apostilled document back—securely packed.

Want a one-line figure for your case? Send your scan \+ destination. We'll reply with the **exact route and price** (and tell you if the cheaper **e-Apostille on a copy** is possible).

## Why do quotes vary?

* **Document type:** personal vs educational vs commercial.  
* **Route:** **HRD** (education), **SDM/Home** (personal), **CoC** (commercial) change both price and timeline.  
* **Original vs copy:** **e-Apostille** on scans can reduce logistics; **Sticker** on originals needs shipping.  
* **City & urgency:** local workloads and courier distances matter.  
* **Number of documents:** most providers offer **tiered discounts**.

## Is e-Apostille (QR) cheaper?

The **MEA fee** is similar to Sticker. e-Apostille can lower **logistics** (no physical shipping) when scans are accepted.  
 If your case needs **university/board genuineness** or **State/SDM/CoC** first, those costs still apply. Some recipients also insist on **Sticker** or **originals**—always follow their written checklist.

## Can I pay only the MEA fee?

If your case truly needs **only** the MEA step: you pay the **MEA govt fee (₹50/₹90)** + a modest **service charge ({inr(price('meaApostille'))})** + any **logistics** (if applicable).  
Most real-world cases, though, require at least **Notary** and often **SDM/HRD/CoC** before MEA.

## Discounts for multiple documents

* **2-5 documents:** **5% off**  
* **5+ documents:** **10% off**

Applied **per document** and covers **Notary \+ (SDM/HRD/CoC) \+ MEA**. Your final quote reflects these savings.

## Bottom line

Understanding the **components**—MEA fee, pre-attestation, handling, and logistics—helps you read quotes confidently and avoid surprises.

If you'd like a **single, transparent price** for your exact case, share your document type and the recipient's checklist. **EasyApostille** will confirm the correct route and send you a clear, no-pressure quote.
