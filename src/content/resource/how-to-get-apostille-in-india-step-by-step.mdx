Getting an apostille for the first time can be confusing. This guide explains the standard procedure, the process with an external agency and how <Anchor href="/">EasyApostille</Anchor> can simplify everything- whether it's a student visa, working abroad or family-related processes.

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) is the only authority that issues apostilles in India. 

 If you are not familiar with the term, start here: <Anchor href="/resources/what-is-apostille-meaning-process-certificate/">What is an Apostille - Meaning, Procedure & Certificate</Anchor>.

### Apostille Types in India

* **Sticker Apostille** → A physical sticker affixed by MEA to the original document.  
* **e-Apostille (QR)** → A **digital apostille** with QR verification; widely accepted by Hague Convention countries.

## Standard Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Check requirements

  * Identify your **document type**: **personal**, **educational**, or **commercial**.  
  * Confirm if the destination is a **Hague member** (apostille) or **non-Hague** (embassy/legalization).
  * Determine if the **original** or a **notarized copy** is needed (send us a scan for a quick check).

In most cases, **originals** are needed for specific personal documents (like PCC, which are one time usage and valid only for 3 to 12 months), while **notarized copies** are acceptable for educational and commercial documents. 

Check this detailed guide: <Anchor href="/resources/apostille-on-original-vs-copy-certificate-india/">Apostille on Original vs Copy Certificate in India</Anchor>. 

### 2. Notary Attestation

  * The first validation layer for many **personal affidavits** and **commercial documents** (e.g., POA, agreements).  
  * You can do this at local **Notary/Bar Association** counters or court complexes.

### 3. State / SDM / HRD / CoC Authentication

Authentication depends on document **classification** (full DIY guide here): <Anchor href="/resources/hrd-vs-sdm-vs-home-state-department-attestation/">Document Authentication in India (DIY): Personal, Educational & Commercial</Anchor>, as below.

  * **Personal:** **Home Dept/H\&GAD** or **SDM/ADM** (district level).  
  * **Educational:** **State HRD/Education Department** (some States need University/Board verification first).  
  * **Commercial:** **Chamber of Commerce (CoC)** attestation.

This State/SDM/HRD/CoC step is **often mandatory** before MEA submission.

### 4. MEA Apostille (Sticker or e-Apostille)

  * **Sticker Apostille:** Original document is submitted via authorized centers; sticker is affixed and returned.  
  * **e-Apostille (QR):** Issued digitally in eligible cases from clear scans.

**Outsourcing of receipt and Delivery of Documents.** As a result to outsourcing of receipt and delivery of documents for attestation/Apostille with effect from July 2012, no document is directly accepted from individuals at the Ministry of External Affairs Counter at CPV Division, Patiala House Annexe, New Delhi.
</BlockQuote>

### 5. Delivery of Document

You'll receive either:

* **Original \+ Sticker Apostille**, or  
* **e-Apostille PDF** with a **QR verification** link.

## Practical Timelines (Typical)

* **Notary \+ SDM (personal route):** Often **same day**.  
* **State HRD/Home Dept:** **2-3 working days** (varies by State and workload).  
* **Agency submission & return (MEA):** **3-5 working days** in many cases.

**Overall:** **4-10 days** depending on the route, State, and courier transit.

To avoid running between counters (Notary → SDM/Home/HRD → CoC → MEA) and to cut errors/rejections, most applicants use an **authorized agency**.

## Outsourcing Agency Process

Since MEA uses **outsourced centers**, individuals typically apply through **authorized agents**:

1. **Submit** originals or scans (agency/courier pickup available).  
2. Agency coordinates **Notary → SDM/Home/HRD/CoC → MEA** in the correct order.  
3. **Receive** Sticker or e-Apostille with tracking and status updates.

<CalloutBox type="alert" title="Challenges">
 The MEA does not accept walk-in submissions from individuals. You must go through an authorized agency for apostille services in India.
Each agency has its own timelines, fee structures, and documentation requirements, which may confuse first-time applicants.
</CalloutBox>
