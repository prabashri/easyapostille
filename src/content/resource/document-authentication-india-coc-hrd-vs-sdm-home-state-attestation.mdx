faq:
  - question: "Do degrees need HRD?"
    answer: "In many States, yes—higher education documents are authenticated by the State HRD/Education Department. Some routes allow SDM, but follow the receiving authority's checklist."
  - question: "What about personal documents like birth/marriage/PCC?"
    answer: "These usually go via your district SDM/ADM or the State Home/General Administration Department. Some destinations insist on Home Dept—check before you apply."
  - question: "Do commercial documents require HRD or SDM?"
    answer: "No. Commercial papers are typically notarized (as needed) and attested by a recognized Chamber of Commerce before MEA apostille."
  - question: "Is e-Sanad an alternative to physical pre-attestation?"
    answer: "If your University/Board is on e-Sanad, prefer that digital route for eligible educational documents. Otherwise, use manual HRD."
  - question: "Does the destination care which pre-auth I used?"
    answer: "Most only verify the MEA apostille. However, universities/employers sometimes insist on HRD. Always follow their latest written instructions."

Before the MEA puts an **apostille** on your document, authentication from the concerned departments like **HRD (Human Resource Department) vs State or Home Department vs SDM (Sub-Magistrate Department) or** CoC (**Chamber of Commerce) is important.** 

Which is the correct department to get authentication for our document?

Let's figure it out!.

## TL;DR — Pick your route fast

* **Personal documents** (birth, marriage, PCC, affidavits) → **State Home/General Administration Dept (Home/GAD)** **or** your district **SDM/ADM** → **MEA Apostille**  
* **Educational documents** (degree, diploma, marksheets, transcripts) → **State HRD/Education Dept** (some States need **University/Board genuineness** first) → **MEA Apostille**  
* **Commercial documents** (POA, invoices, CoO, board resolutions) → **Recognized Chamber of Commerce (CoC)** → **MEA Apostille**

**e-Sanad:** If your **University/Board** is listed, you can often complete **verification \+ apostille digitally**. If not, use the manual routes above.

## Step 1 — Classify your document

### A) Personal (civil & individual)

Birth/Death, Marriage, Divorce, Name/Gazette change, Single-status affidavit, **PCC**, Medical fitness, Employment/Experience/Salary letters.  
 **Authority:** **Home/GAD** of your State **or** **SDM/ADM** of your district or delhi sdm.

### B) Educational (school, college, university)

Degree/Provisional, Consolidated & Semester marksheets, Diploma, SSLC/HSC, Bonafide/Verification letters, Transcripts.  
 **Authority:** **State HRD/Education Dept** of the **issuing State** (plus **University/Board genuineness** if your State demands it).  
 **Note:** Prefer **e-Sanad** where available.

### C) Commercial (business & trade)

Invoice, Certificate of Origin, Agency/Distribution Agreement, Board Resolution, MOA/AOA, Incorporation Certificate, **POA**, Contracts.  
 **Authority:** **Chamber of Commerce** (national/state/local) — **not** HRD/SDM/Home.

## Step 2 — Notarization (when & where)

**When it's needed:**

* Common for **personal affidavits** (single-status, name correction), many **commercial papers** (POA/contracts), and sometimes for **true-copy** attestation.  
* Usually **not required** for **educational originals** unless your State asks.  
* But mostly SDM, HRD, State department required notarization of the documents irrespective of original or copy.

**Where to find a Notary:**

* **District/Taluk/Civil Courts** (Bar/Advocates' halls)  
* **Collectorate / District Magistrate** public counters  
* **Bar Associations** (ask for on-duty registered notaries)

**Carry:** original(s) \+ 1-2 photocopies, **ID/passport**, and **e-stamp/stamp paper** for affidavits. Ensure **seal \+ reg. no. \+ date \+ place** are legible.

## Route A — Personal documents (Home Department or SDM)

**Who authenticates:**

* **State Home/General Administration Department (Home/GAD)**, or  
* **District SDM/ADM** (Collectorate/Magistrate office).  
   Some destinations/embassies **insist on Home Dept** instead of SDM—**check your checklist**.

**DIY steps:**

1. **Notarize** if required (affidavit/true copy).  
2. Submit at **Home Dept Attestation Cell** **or** **SDM/ADM** with original \+ copy, ID, application/fee.  
3. Collect with **Home/SDM stamp & signature**.  
4. Proceed to **MEA apostille**.

**Example venues (illustrative):** State Secretariat/Home Dept; **District Collectorate (SDM/ADM)** (e.g., Chennai District Collectorate for Chennai).

## Route B — Educational documents (HRD/Education)

**Who authenticates:** The **State HRD/Education Department** of the **issuing State**.

**DIY steps:**

1. Get **University/Board genuineness** if your State requires it.  
2. Submit originals \+ copies, verification letter (if any), ID, application/fee at **RD/Education Dept** (or **RAC**, if notified).  
3. Collect with **HRD/Education authentication**.  
4. Proceed to **MEA apostille**.  
5. If your Board/University is on **e-Sanad**, prefer that digital route.

## Route C — Commercial documents (Chamber of Commerce)

**Who authenticates:** A **recognized Chamber of Commerce** (ASSOCHAM, PHD, FIEO, State Chambers, EPCs, etc.).

**DIY steps:**

1. **Notarize** (usually for POA/contracts).  
2. Submit to your **CoC** with originals/copies, **PAN/GST/CIN**, and the attestation fee (or membership where needed).  
3. Collect **CoC attestation**.  
4. Proceed to **MEA apostille**.

Typical locations: **State Secretariat / Education Directorates**, **District Collectorate (SDM/ADM)**, **University Controller of Examinations**, **Bar Association** halls, and **major Chambers** with export desks.

## What to carry?

**1. Personal (Home/SDM)**

  * Original certificate(s) \+ **1–2 copies**  
  * **ID/Passport** copy  
  * **Notarized affidavit** (if applicable: single-status, name mismatch)  
  * 2-4 Passport size photo copies (depend upon state)  
  * Consent form with personal contact details  
  * Fee/receipt/DD as required

**2. Educational (HRD/Education)**

  * Original **degree/diploma/marksheets \+ 1-2 copies**  
  * **ID/Passport copy**  
  * **University/Board verification** (if your State requires it)  
  * ID copy, application form, fee/receipt  
  * Consent form with personal contact details  
  * (Optional) Notarized copy, only if asked

**3. Commercial (Chamber of Commerce)**

  * Original document(s) \+ copies  
  * **Notarized** POA/agreements (if applicable)  
  * Company **PAN/GST/CIN**, authorization letter (if staff submits)  
  * CoC membership/attestation fee

## Common pitfalls (avoid rejections)

* **Wrong authority**: Using **SDM** when the recipient strictly requires **Home Dept**, or sending education docs without **HRD** when demanded.  
* **Illegible seals**: Notary/authority seal must show **name, reg. no., date & place**.  
* **Old PCC/medicals**: Many authorities demand **recently issued** versions.  
* **Language**: Non-English/Hindi documents often need a **certified translation** *before* authentication.  
* **Name mismatches**: Add **Gazette** or a **notarized declaration**.

## After State/CoC authentication → MEA apostille

* If **e-Sanad eligible**: finish online with **e-Apostille (QR)**.  
* If **not eligible**: submit through **authorized collection centers/outsourced agencies** (walk-in/courier, per the center’s process).  
* Pricing & examples:  
  * **/resources/what-is-apostille-meaning-process-certificate/**  
  * **/resources/apostille-price-cost-per-document-in-india/**

## Original vs Copy (quick rule, with examples)

Full guide: **/resources/apostille-on-original-vs-copy-certificate-india/**

* **Short validity & will be returned** (e.g., **PCC**, medical): **apostille the original**.  
* **Long validity & may be retained** (e.g., **degree**, some family documents): **apostille a notarized copy** (often **e-Apostille**), **if allowed** by the recipient.  
* Always follow the **recipient's written checklist**.

## Summary flow

**Personal:** Notary (if needed) → **Home/SDM** → **MEA apostille**  
 **Educational:** Univ/Board (if asked) → **State HRD/Education** → **MEA apostille**  
 **Commercial:** Notary (if needed) → **Chamber of Commerce** → **MEA apostille**

Keep photocopies of every page with visible **seals & dates**. When in doubt, confirm whether your destination insists on **Home Dept** (not SDM) or **HRD** for education.

## Prefer a done-for-you option?

**EasyApostille** can:

* Confirm the **correct route** (Home vs SDM vs HRD vs CoC) based on your **destination's checklist**.  
* Arrange **Notary, translations**, and **State submissions**.  
* Handle **MEA apostille** and **pickup/courier return** with real-time updates.

Send a scan of your document \+ the recipient's requirement. We'll tell you **exactly what's needed**—**before** you spend time or money.
