faq:
  - question: "Where should I apply for PCC—Passport Seva (PSK/PO) or local police?"
    answer: "Most applicants use Passport Seva Kendra/Passport Office (PSK/PO) via the Passport Seva portal; it’s widely accepted for visas/immigration. Some authorities also accept PCC from local police/commissionerate. Check your destination’s requirement before choosing."
    speakable: true
  - question: "What documents are required for PCC?"
    answer: "Valid passport, current address proof (Aadhaar/utility/lease), recent photo, and appointment receipt. If your address changed since last passport issuance, carry proof for the new address."
  - question: "How long does PCC take in India?"
    answer: "Processing often completes in 1–7 working days after the appointment, depending on police verification needs and local queue. Track status on the Passport Seva portal/SMS updates."
  - question: "What are the fees for PCC?"
    answer: "Passport Seva PCC has a nominal government fee (shown during online application). Additional costs may arise for photos, notarization, or courier if you opt for those services."
  - question: "How do I track my PCC status?"
    answer: "Use the Passport Seva portal with your File Number/Date of Birth. You’ll also receive SMS/email updates for police verification, approval, and PCC issuance."
  - question: "How long is a PCC valid?"
    answer: "Validity is set by the receiving authority (often 3–6 months). Apostille or attestation does not extend validity—obtain a fresh PCC if your destination requires recent issuance."
  - question: "Can I get PCC while living abroad?"
    answer: "Yes. Apply through the Indian Mission/Consulate covering your location. Timelines vary by country; local police/consular verification may be required."
  - question: "What’s the difference between PSK/PO PCC and local police PCC?"
    answer: "PSK/PO PCC is issued under Passport Act workflows and is widely recognized internationally; local police PCC is city/state issued and may be accepted for certain purposes. Always confirm which your destination requires."
  - question: "Do I need apostille/attestation on my PCC?"
    answer: "For Hague countries, many ask for PCC with MEA apostille (sticker or e-Apostille QR). For non-Hague countries, embassy/consulate attestation is typically required."
  - question: "Can someone apply on my behalf?"
    answer: "For PSK/PO applications, you generally need to appear in person for biometrics/verification. For special circumstances, check current PSK guidelines or your local police authority."
