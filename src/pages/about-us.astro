			<h2 id="why-we-built-astroweb-theme">Why we Built the AstroWEB Theme?</h2>
			<p>
			When we first started designing websites for personal brands, small businesses, 
			and client projects, <strong>WordPress + hosting</strong> was the natural choice. 
			It offered flexibility, plugins, and easy deployment. But as the web evolved, 
			so did the need for <strong>faster, lighter, and more modern solutions</strong>.
			</p>
			And not everyone needed a full CMS like WordPress. Many just wanted a simple,
			lightweight site that could be built quickly and easily. also, the need for cost effective and easy to use in the VIBE coding, AI agent era.
			<p>
			This is when <strong>Astro.build</strong> and <strong>Hugo</strong> entered the picture.
			Hugo is an excellent static site generator‚Äîlightning fast, but primarily focused on 
			content-heavy blog websites. In contrast, Astro brought a unique capability:
			<strong>build fast static sites and powerful React-based apps in the same framework</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
			As a digital agency working on diverse projects, we need to use different building frameworks like React. The flexibility of Astro with Vite provided option to design HTML layouts. 
			
			However, when we looked for a <strong>modern, flexible, production-ready theme</strong> 
			to launch quickly for both apps and websites‚Ä¶ there wasn't one.
			</p>
			We have scrolled through many themes, but none of them were designed to be flexible enough for both personal and client projects. Most were either too opinionated or too basic.
			<p>
			That's when we decided to build the <strong>AstroWEB Theme</strong>‚Äîa solution 
			combining clean design, performance optimization, and ready-to-use features 
			for agencies, freelancers, and developers within 10 - 15 minutes to live with the content.
			</p>

			<h2 id="our-goal">Our Goal</h2>
