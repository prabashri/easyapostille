In short: short validity period and get back upon submission, proceed with the original documents.","tags":["apostille","india","documents","original","copy","visa","study abroad","e-apostille","sticker"],"authors":["prabakaran-shankar"],"lastModified":1759128131145,"content":"import CalloutBox from '@/components/ui/CalloutBox.astro' import Anchor from '@/components/ui/Anchor.astro' import BlockQuote from '@/components/ui/BlockQuote.astro' import Table from '@/components/ui/Table.astro' import ResponsiveImage from '@/components/ResponsiveImage.astro' When you start the apostille process, the most important question is:\\ **“Do I need an apostille on the original or on a copy?”** Quick answer: * If the document has a **short validity period** (PCC/medical) and **will be returned after submission**, get apostille affixed to the original. * If the document has a **long validity period** (graduation, marriage, birth) and **may not be returned**, get the **apostille affixed to a copy** (often e-Apostille (QR)). In practice, your choice depends on document type, the regulations of the destination country and whether you use a sticker or an e-Apostille.\\ Let's take a closer look. ## How to decide (3 factors that are important) 1. Type of document * **Personal:** birth/marriage/death, PCC, medical documents, affidavits * **Educational:** Degree, diploma, grade sheets, transcripts * **Business:** POA, contracts, invoices, CoO, board resolutions 2. Regulations of the destination country (college, embassy, employer, immigration authority) * Some insist on an apostille on the original. * Others accept notarized copies with an apostille- especially if the originals are retained. 3. Type of apostille * **Sticker apostille**: physical sticker on the original. * **e-Apostille (QR):** digital apostille from scans; widely accepted in the Hague countries (but check if your recipient prefers a sticker). ## When you need to apostille the original the certificate/document Choose **stickers on the original** if: * The recipient specifies this in their checklist (university/employer/immigration). * They must check the security features (embossing, watermark) with the sticker. * The office is known to refuse copies or only keep certified originals. * The documents are only valid for a short period of time. Common examples * **PCC** for background checks (valid for 3-6 months). In this case, the police clearance certificate is only issued for a unique reason. For example, a PCC for immigration to the country. * **Medical certificates**/vaccination certificates. These are usually only valid for 1-3 months and are required for a specific purpose. * Some **university admissions** require apostilled original degrees/grades. * **Immigration**/registration offices for family documents (birth/marriage). * **Work visas** where the HR department insists on an original apostilled degree to verify authenticity. **Pros:** generally understandable; fewer queries later.\\ **Cons:** Your original leaves your hands; **reissue may take some time** if kept. **Note on provisional certificates**: Many universities treat provisional transcripts at deadlines like graduation and may require an apostille on the original provisional transcript. Always follow the recipient's written instructions. ## When to apostille a photocopy (copy) Choose the apostille on a copy (often e-Apostille) if: * The document has a **long validity** (e.g. graduation, marriage/birth) and the authority is likely to keep it. * You need to **keep the original** for later use/verification. * The recipient expressly accepts apostilled copies. Common examples * Many **embassies require educational documents** to be presented for visa applications. In this case, you must keep the original. So do it on photocopies. * **Personal documents** such as birth/marriage certificates must be presented to confirm your identity. The apostille on photocopies is therefore the better option. * **Business documents** (contracts/POA), the originals of which remain in the company's files. **Pros:** protects your original; often faster; easy QR verification.\\ **Cons:** some authorities still insist on a **sticker on the original-** confirm it first. ## Quick Guide — Original vs Copy\n\n| Document type / case | Safer choice | Why | | ----- | ----- | ----- | | **Degree certificate** | **Copies (sticker) Copies (e-apostille) Original (Sticker)** | Commonly required for university/employer scrutiny. | | **Marksheets / Transcripts** | **Copies (sticker) Copies (e-apostille) Original (Sticker)** | Copies often accepted; sealed transcripts may be separate. | | **PCC** | **Original (Sticker) Copy (sticker)** | Short validity and raise only for certain purpose | | **Medical/Fitness** | **Original (Sticker) Copy (sticker)** | Short validity; QR is enough for verification. | | **Birth / Marriage / Death** | **Copies (sticker) Copies (e-apostille) Original (Sticker)** | Civil/immigration offices often demand originals. | | **Affidavits (name change/single-status)** | **Copies (sticker) Copies (e-apostille) Original (Sticker)** | Mostly accessible as public documents | | **Commercial (POA, CoO, invoices, board resolutions)** | **Copy (sticker) Copies (e-apostille)** | Businesses usually apostille true copies; originals remain on record. |\n\n## Practical advice for visa applications * **Student Visa (EU/US):** Universities often accept **apostilled copies** of marksheets/transcripts; embassies may require **original PCC** or **original birth certificate**. * **Work Visa (Middle East):** Employers typically want **apostilled original degree** + **original PCC**. * **Dependent/Family Visa:** Many posts require **apostilled original marriage** and **original birth** certificates. * **Business/Trade:** **Apostilled copies** of **POA/invoices/CoO** are usually fine—no need to risk originals. **Country & authority rules change.** Always read the latest checklist from your recipient. ## Key takeaways * **Check the checklist first.** If it says “apostille on original,” don't send a copy. * As a rule of thumb: **personal/civil → originals**, **educational/commercial → copies often fine** (but verify). * **e-Apostille (QR)** can be faster and safer where accepted. * If you're unsure, **share a scan**—we'll confirm **scan vs notarized copy vs original** **before** you proceed.

You'll often see quotes that look much higher than the official **MEA fee of ₹50 or ₹90** per document. Why is there such a difference in cost? In short, agencies include charges for **notary, pre-attestation (Notary/SDM/HRD/CoC)** required for MEA apostille submission, as well as additional fees for **handling and logistics**. Not sure which pre-attestation you need? See our guide: **HRD vs SDM vs Home Dept vs CoC**, for the MEA apostille of your document. This page explains every component and shows **realistic totals** you can expect. ## Official MEA Apostille Fee * **MEA government fee:** **₹50 / ₹90 per document** (category-dependent) * This is **only** the government fee for issuing the apostille. It does **not** include Notary, SDM/HRD/CoC, agency handling, or courier.\n\n> A fee of Rs 50 is payable for Apostille of document. (W.e.f 21 December 2016, payment by means of postal orders has been discontinued.) Normal Attestation is done free of cost.\\ The fee chargeable by the outsourced agencies per document for its collection and delivery for Apostille/normal attestation by MEA will be Rs. 84/- (Service Fee) and Rs 3 per page (Scanning Fee).\n\n## Additional Components of Apostille Pricing When agencies quote **₹1,700-₹6,000** (or more) per document, they're usually bundling steps **beyond** the MEA fee: 1. **Notary attestation:** starts around **₹100** (varies by office & doc type). Some centers list ~**₹160**/doc. 2. **State/Home Dept (“State attestation”):** ~**₹500 - ₹6,750+** (varies by State). 3. **HRD (education):** ~**₹2,500 - ₹24,000** depending on State/university verification. Even on **e-Sanad**, some universities charge separate genuineness (often **₹500-₹4,500**). 4. **SDM attestation:** ~**₹500 - ₹2,500** for verification/service in many places; packaged Delhi SDM routes are often quoted around **₹4,110**. 5. **Chamber of Commerce (CoC) attestation** - commercial docs: now commonly ₹400-₹450 per page (attested page count). 6. **Professional handling:** document checks, forms, queues, status updates, GST. 7. **Courier / pickup & return:** varies by location/urgency. Prices above are **indicative** and can change by provider, city, workload, and taxes.\\ **Last checked:** 28 Sep 2025 To avoid confusion, Easyapotille bundles all the processes \\[Notary + SDM (Delhi) + MEA Apostille + Logistics] for {inr(price('sdmBundle'))} and offers discounts for multiple documents. ## Quick Price Table (India)\n\n| Component / Service | Typical Price (INR) | Notes | | ----- | ----- | ----- | | **MEA government fee** | **₹50 / ₹90** | Official MEA charge | | **Notary (true copy / affidavit)** | **~ ₹160 to 1000** | Per document (common listing) | | **State/Home Dept attestation** | **₹500 - ₹6,750+** | Varies by State | | **HRD attestation** | **₹1,500 - ₹24,000** | Depends on State/university | | **SDM attestation (Delhi SDM)** | **₹500 - ₹4,110** | District SDM pre-auth | | **Chamber of Commerce (CoC)** | **₹450 - ₹1000** | Commercial pre-auth | | **Door pickup & return** | **₹800 - ₹ 1100** | Serviceable locations only |\n\n**EasyApostille one-price option** * **Bundle:** **Notary + SDM (Delhi) + MEA Apostille + logistics** * **Price:** **{inr(price('sdmBundle'))} per document** * **Discounts:** **5-10%** for multiple docs * **HRD / CoC:** quoted separately if your case needs them ## Why choose EasyApostille ({inr(price('sdmBundle'))} all-inclusive SDM bundle) We optimize the entire chain—**Notary → SDM (Delhi) → MEA Apostille**—by coordinating submissions through **MEA-authorized outsourced partner centers**.

The **MEA fee** is similar to Sticker. e-Apostille can lower **logistics** (no physical shipping) when scans are accepted.\\ If your case needs **university/board genuineness** or **State/SDM/CoC** first, those costs still apply. Some recipients also insist on **Sticker** or **originals**—always follow their written checklist. ## Can I pay only the MEA fee? If your case truly needs **only** the MEA step: you pay the **MEA govt fee (₹50/₹90)** + a modest **service charge ({inr(price('meaApostille'))})** + any **logistics** (if applicable).\\ Most real-world cases, though, require at least **Notary** and often **SDM/HRD/CoC** before MEA. ## Discounts for multiple documents * **2-5 documents:** **5% off** * **5+ documents:** **10% off** Applied **per document** and covers **Notary + (SDM/HRD/CoC) + MEA**.

Let's figure it out!. ## TL;DR — Pick your route fast * **Personal documents** (birth, marriage, PCC, affidavits) → **State Home/General Administration Dept (Home/GAD)** **or** your district **SDM/ADM** → **MEA Apostille** * **Educational documents** (degree, diploma, marksheets, transcripts) → **State HRD/Education Dept** (some States need **University/Board genuineness** first) → **MEA Apostille** * **Commercial documents** (POA, invoices, CoO, board resolutions) → **Recognized Chamber of Commerce (CoC)** → **MEA Apostille** **e-Sanad:** If your **University/Board** is listed, you can often complete **verification + apostille digitally**. If not, use the manual routes above. ## Step 1 — Classify your document ### A) Personal (civil & individual) Birth/Death, Marriage, Divorce, Name/Gazette change, Single-status affidavit, **PCC**, Medical fitness, Employment/Experience/Salary letters.\\ **Authority:** **Home/GAD** of your State **or** **SDM/ADM** of your district or delhi sdm. ### B) Educational (school, college, university) Degree/Provisional, Consolidated & Semester marksheets, Diploma, SSLC/HSC, Bonafide/Verification letters, Transcripts.\\ **Authority:** **State HRD/Education Dept** of the **issuing State** (plus **University/Board genuineness** if your State demands it).\\ **Note:** Prefer **e-Sanad** where available. ### C) Commercial (business & trade) Invoice, Certificate of Origin, Agency/Distribution Agreement, Board Resolution, MOA/AOA, Incorporation Certificate, **POA**, Contracts.\\ **Authority:** **Chamber of Commerce** (national/state/local) — **not** HRD/SDM/Home. ## Step 2 — Notarization (when & where) **When it's needed:** * Common for **personal affidavits** (single-status, name correction), many **commercial papers** (POA/contracts), and sometimes for **true-copy** attestation. * Usually **not required** for **educational originals** unless your State asks. * But mostly SDM, HRD, State department required notarization of the documents irrespective of original or copy. **Where to find a Notary:** * **District/Taluk/Civil Courts** (Bar/Advocates' halls) * **Collectorate / District Magistrate** public counters * **Bar Associations** (ask for on-duty registered notaries) **Carry:** original(s) + 1-2 photocopies, **ID/passport**, and **e-stamp/stamp paper** for affidavits. Ensure **seal + reg. no. + date + place** are legible. ## Route A — Personal documents (Home Department or SDM) **Who authenticates:** * **State Home/General Administration Department (Home/GAD)**, or * **District SDM/ADM** (Collectorate/Magistrate office).\\ Some destinations/embassies **insist on Home Dept** instead of SDM—**check your checklist**. **DIY steps:** 1. **Notarize** if required (affidavit/true copy). 2. Submit at **Home Dept Attestation Cell** **or** **SDM/ADM** with original + copy, ID, application/fee. 3. Collect with **Home/SDM stamp & signature**. 4. Proceed to **MEA apostille**. **Example venues (illustrative):** State Secretariat/Home Dept; **District Collectorate (SDM/ADM)** (e.g., Chennai District Collectorate for Chennai). ## Route B — Educational documents (HRD/Education) **Who authenticates:** The **State HRD/Education Department** of the **issuing State**. **DIY steps:** 1. Get **University/Board genuineness** if your State requires it. 2. Submit originals + copies, verification letter (if any), ID, application/fee at **RD/Education Dept** (or **RAC**, if notified). 3. Collect with **HRD/Education authentication**. 4. Proceed to **MEA apostille**. 5. If your Board/University is on **e-Sanad**, prefer that digital route. ## Route C — Commercial documents (Chamber of Commerce) **Who authenticates:** A **recognized Chamber of Commerce** (ASSOCHAM, PHD, FIEO, State Chambers, EPCs, etc.). **DIY steps:** 1. **Notarize** (usually for POA/contracts). 2. Submit to your **CoC** with originals/copies, **PAN/GST/CIN**, and the attestation fee (or membership where needed). 3. Collect **CoC attestation**. 4. Proceed to **MEA apostille**. Typical locations: **State Secretariat / Education Directorates**, **District Collectorate (SDM/ADM)**, **University Controller of Examinations**, **Bar Association** halls, and **major Chambers** with export desks. ## What to carry? **1. Personal (Home/SDM)** * Original certificate(s) + **1–2 copies** * **ID/Passport** copy * **Notarized affidavit** (if applicable: single-status, name mismatch) * 2-4 Passport size photo copies (depend upon state) * Consent form with personal contact details * Fee/receipt/DD as required **2. Educational (HRD/Education)** * Original **degree/diploma/marksheets + 1-2 copies** * **ID/Passport copy** * **University/Board verification** (if your State requires it) * ID copy, application form, fee/receipt * Consent form with personal contact details * (Optional) Notarized copy, only if asked **3. Commercial (Chamber of Commerce)** * Original document(s) + copies * **Notarized** POA/agreements (if applicable) * Company **PAN/GST/CIN**, authorization letter (if staff submits) * CoC membership/attestation fee ## Common pitfalls (avoid rejections) * **Wrong authority**: Using **SDM** when the recipient strictly requires **Home Dept**, or sending education docs without **HRD** when demanded. * **Illegible seals**: Notary/authority seal must show **name, reg. no., date & place**. * **Old PCC/medicals**: Many authorities demand **recently issued** versions. * **Language**: Non-English/Hindi documents often need a **certified translation** *before* authentication. * **Name mismatches**: Add **Gazette** or a **notarized declaration**. ## After State/CoC authentication → MEA apostille * If **e-Sanad eligible**: finish online with **e-Apostille (QR)**. * If **not eligible**: submit through **authorized collection centers/outsourced agencies** (walk-in/courier, per the center’s process). * Pricing & examples: * **/resources/what-is-apostille-meaning-process-certificate/** * **/resources/apostille-price-cost-per-document-in-india/** ## Original vs Copy (quick rule, with examples) Full guide: **/resources/apostille-on-original-vs-copy-certificate-india/** * **Short validity & will be returned** (e.g., **PCC**, medical): **apostille the original**. * **Long validity & may be retained** (e.g., **degree**, some family documents): **apostille a notarized copy** (often **e-Apostille**), **if allowed** by the recipient. * Always follow the **recipient's written checklist**. ## Summary flow **Personal:** Notary (if needed) → **Home/SDM** → **MEA apostille**\\ **Educational:** Univ/Board (if asked) → **State HRD/Education** → **MEA apostille**\\ **Commercial:** Notary (if needed) → **Chamber of Commerce** → **MEA apostille** Keep photocopies of every page with visible **seals & dates**.

This guide explains the standard procedure, the process with an external agency and how EasyApostille can simplify everything- whether it's a student visa, working abroad or family-related processes. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) is the only authority that issues apostilles in India. If you are not familiar with the term, start here: What is an Apostille - Meaning, Procedure & Certificate. ### Apostille Types in India * **Sticker Apostille** → A physical sticker affixed by MEA to the original document. * **e-Apostille (QR)** → A **digital apostille** with QR verification; widely accepted by Hague Convention countries. ## Standard Step-by-Step Process ### 1. Check requirements * Identify your **document type**: **personal**, **educational**, or **commercial**. * Confirm if the destination is a **Hague member** (apostille) or **non-Hague** (embassy/legalization). * Determine if the **original** or a **notarized copy** is needed (send us a scan for a quick check). In most cases, **originals** are needed for specific personal documents (like PCC, which are one time usage and valid only for 3 to 12 months), while **notarized copies** are acceptable for educational and commercial documents. Check this detailed guide: Apostille on Original vs Copy Certificate in India. ### 2. Notary Attestation * The first validation layer for many **personal affidavits** and **commercial documents** (e.g., POA, agreements). * You can do this at local **Notary/Bar Association** counters or court complexes. ### 3. State / SDM / HRD / CoC Authentication Authentication depends on document **classification** (full DIY guide here): Document Authentication in India (DIY): Personal, Educational & Commercial, as below. * **Personal:** **Home Dept/H\\&GAD** or **SDM/ADM** (district level). * **Educational:** **State HRD/Education Department** (some States need University/Board verification first). * **Commercial:** **Chamber of Commerce (CoC)** attestation. This State/SDM/HRD/CoC step is **often mandatory** before MEA submission. ### 4. MEA Apostille (Sticker or e-Apostille) * **Sticker Apostille:** Original document is submitted via authorized centers; sticker is affixed and returned. * **e-Apostille (QR):** Issued digitally in eligible cases from clear scans.\n\n> **Outsourcing of receipt and Delivery of Documents.** As a result to outsourcing of receipt and delivery of documents for attestation/Apostille with effect from July 2012, no document is directly accepted from individuals at the Ministry of External Affairs Counter at CPV Division, Patiala House Annexe, New Delhi.\n\n### 5. Delivery of Document You'll receive either: * **Original + Sticker Apostille**, or * **e-Apostille PDF** with a **QR verification** link. ## Practical Timelines (Typical) * **Notary + SDM (personal route):** Often **same day**. * **State HRD/Home Dept:** **2-3 working days** (varies by State and workload). * **Agency submission & return (MEA):** **3-5 working days** in many cases. **Overall:** **4-10 days** depending on the route, State, and courier transit. To avoid running between counters (Notary → SDM/Home/HRD → CoC → MEA) and to cut errors/rejections, most applicants use an **authorized agency**. ## Outsourcing Agency Process Since MEA uses **outsourced centers**, individuals typically apply through **authorized agents**: 1. **Submit** originals or scans (agency/courier pickup available). 2. Agency coordinates **Notary → SDM/Home/HRD/CoC → MEA** in the correct order. 3. **Receive** Sticker or e-Apostille with tracking and status updates. The MEA does not accept walk-in submissions from individuals. You must go through an authorized agency for apostille services in India. Each agency has its own timelines, fee structures, and documentation requirements, which may confuse first-time applicants. ## How EasyApostille Makes It Simple We remove the guesswork and give you a single, transparent path: * **✅ Fast eligibility check:** Share a scan; we confirm if the **original** is required. * **✅ Pickup & delivery pan-India:** No queues, no travel to multiple offices. * **✅ Clear tracking:** Real-time **WhatsApp/Email** updates with your order ID. * **✅ Right apostille type:** **e-Apostille (QR)** or **Sticker**, based on your destination's requirement. * **✅ Secure handling:** Tamper-proof packaging + insured courier return. * **✅ Cost clarity:** Up-front **all-inclusive** quote—no hidden add-ons.

But what exactly does it mean, why is it required, and how do you get an apostille for your documents? This guide by EasyApostille explains the **meaning of apostille, its process in India, and certificate details**, so you know exactly what to expect. ## What is Apostille? An **apostille** is a form of **document authentication** issued under the **Hague Convention of 1961**, which abolished the need for embassy legalization of public documents. In simple terms, an apostille is a **stamp or sticker** placed on your documents by the designated authority that confirms the document is genuine and valid for use in **Hague Convention member countries**. * **Number of countries:** 92 members (in 2025). * **Competent authority in India**: Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). ## Apostille Meaning in India In India, apostille is often called **apostille attestation**. It is mandatory for various situations such as: * **Students:** applying for a student visa or university admission abroad. * **Job seekers:** seeking employment in foreign companies. * **Families:** migrating for reunification, marriage, or adoption. * **Businesses:** expanding operations internationally. * **NRIs:** confirming that documents originated in India. 👉 For **Hague Convention countries**, apostille is valid. For **non-Hague countries**, you will need **embassy attestation** instead following the apostille process. ## What Does an Apostille Look Like? An apostille is usually a **square-shaped sticker** (approximately 9x9 cm) affixed to the back of your document. It must contains the below details approved by Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH) * Title “Apostille (Convention de La Haye du 5 octobre 1961)”. * Country * Name of the public document * has been signed by * acting in the capacity of * bears the seal/stamp of Certified * at ......... ........the * by * No. * seal/stamp ........... signature * is issued to In the below image, the sample certificate issued by HCCH and original apostille stamp of India on a public document degree certificate. ## Apostille vs Attestation - What's the Difference? In general, they used the term “Apostille Attestation”, however both are different and its purpose based on the Hague members. Apostille is valid only in Hague nations, for the non-Hague countries Attestation is accepted. Below is the difference between the two.\n\n| Feature | Apostille | Attestation | | ----- | ----- | ----- | | Valid in Hague countries | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | | Valid in non-Hague countries | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (via Embassy/Consulate) | | Issued by | MEA (India) | Embassy/Consulate | | Verification method | QR code / online | Embassy records | | Processing time | Fast (1–3 days) | Longer (may take weeks) |\n\nIn short: If your destination country is a **Hague Convention member**, you need an **apostille**, not embassy attestation. ## Importance of Apostille for Students and Professionals * **Students**: Required for transcripts, degree certificates, mark sheets, provisional, transfer certificates for admission abroad. * **Job seekers**: Needed for employment contracts and HR clearances. * **Families**: Required for marriage certificates, birth certificates, and adoption documents. * **Businesses**: Commercial agreements and power of attorney often need apostille for international use. Without an apostille, your documents will **not be accepted** in Hague countries. ## How to get an apostille?

In this video we'll walk through hosting your own MP4, adding captions and chapters, and publishing a watch page that’s optimized for SEO and accessibility. **\\[00:18] Host:** First, the **file format**. MP4 with H.264/AAC is widely compatible. Store it on a CDN and expose a stable HTTPS `contentUrl`. If you can, enable range requests and good caching headers. **\\[00:42] Host:** For **poster art**, include a `poster` image and, optionally, multiple `thumbnails`. The layout will use `poster` for social previews and can use `thumbnails` in UI components. **\\[01:03] Host:** Next up: **captions**. Provide WebVTT tracks in the `captions` array. Each track takes a `url`, `lang`, optional `label`, and `default`. This enables accessible playback and improves engagement. **\\[01:28] Host:** **Chapters** help viewers jump to the exact section they need. Add a `chapters` array with `name`, `start` (seconds), and optional `end`/`url`. The layout renders deep links like `?t=210`. **\\[01:55] Host:** For **dimensions**, set `videoWidth` and `videoHeight`. If you leave `aspectRatio` empty, the layout can compute `16:9` or another ratio based on those dimensions. **\\[02:16] Host:** The **watch page** should be canonical for the video. That's why we use `watchPageUrl` and set the `VideoObject` as `mainEntity` via `HeadProps.video.isMainEntity = true` in the layout. **\\[02:38] Host:** Include an **FAQ** section in the same page if you can. Short Q\\&A entries can be output as structured data to answer common queries directly in search. **\\[03:00] Host:** Before publishing, test **load time** and **buffering**. A global CDN, proper caching, and compressed poster images make a big difference. If bandwidth spikes are a concern, consider adding HLS later. **\\[03:22] Host:** That's it! You now have a self-hosted video watch page with captions, chapters, and a complete transcript. Happy publishing. *** ### Download Links * Poster (1280x720): `/images/videos/self-hosted/poster.jpg` * Captions (EN): `https://cdn.example.com/captions/self-hosted-video-example.en.vtt` * Captions (ES): `https://cdn.example.com/captions/self-hosted-video-example.es.vtt`","url":"/videos/self-hosted-video-example/","slug":"self-hosted-video-example","collection":"videos"},{"title":"Video SEO Example: End-to-End Watch Page","description":"Sample video watch page demonstrating frontmatter for VideoObject schema, OG/Twitter tags, and UI rendering.","tags":["video","seo","schema","tutorial"],"authors":[],"lastModified":1757422133360,"content":"> **Note:** This file is named `_example.mdx` so it's intentionally hidden by your index/route filters. > Copy it, rename the file (remove the leading `_`), and tweak fields for a real video. ## What you'll see on the watch page * A responsive player (YouTube embed in this example). * Poster art driving OG/Twitter images; thumbnails available for UI. * Chapters in a sidebar; clicking a chapter seeks in supported players or links with `?t=`. * Captions (VTT) for accessibility and SEO. * VideoObject JSON-LD emitted via `BaseLayout` from the frontmatter above. ### Body Content (Optional) Use this space for extra notes, links, or resources related to the video.
